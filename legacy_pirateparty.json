On one hand they're saying under 18s cannot decide for themselves if a tongue piercing is suitable while also claiming to value the judgement of young people by making them their own young people's parliament.\n \n\n\n\n \"It's a great shame that these young people will not be able to interact within a model parliament that actually represents the Senedd and will not operate transparently. Some of these young people will already have some party affiliation or wish to be a candidate for one, those voting to elect members deserve to know if that candidate has affiliations with Labour, Conservatives, Plaid Cymru, UKIP... or the National Front for instance.\n \n\n\n\n \"A party declaration would also give an indication on what priorities that young person would have, for example a Pirate Party candidate would want to\n [invest in teachers](/policy/education/invest-teachers) \n and let all schools access a\n [national media library](/policy/education/let-all-schools-access-national-media-library) \n . PPUK have also been long standing supporters of\n [votes at 16](/policy/restoring-trust-government/votes-16) \n and would give consideration to\n [allowing some to leave school at 14](/policy/education/reduce-school-leaving-age) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Party disclosure is a useful tool for the electorate.\"\n \n\n\n\n Pirate Party UK Spokesperson for Wales, David A Elston said:\n \n\n\n\n \"Many of those going into the WYP will still be in education and naturally much debate will surround that sector. Education is a devolved sector in Wales, but despite this, the way our schools are run has not been brought into the 21st century. While expensive IT equipment such as top of the range Mac computers and ipads are in schools, seldom are they used when compared to a pencil or any other out of date equipment. It is no longer acceptable in the workplace to use pen and paper, instead everything is documented on a computer, or is later transferred on to one. The default teaching still being pen and paper, is wildly out of date.\n \n\n\n\n \"While the introduction of computing in early years has moved on, where now it should be reasonably common for someone 8 years old to have some kind of very simple programming lessons, there's nothing like a raspberry pi in sight and teaching staff frequently still struggle with basics, such as how to attach a PDF to an e-mail. In order for our children to be computer literate, they need to be supported by\n [qualified teaching staff](/policy/education/ensure-teachers-are-qualified-teach) \n .\"\n \n\n\n\n Likely partly due to these issues, the Pirate Party has enjoyed some success here in Wales. The party has contested national elections in Bridgend, Cardiff, Swansea and the Vale of Glamorgan while steadily increasing their votes, gaining 7.6% in a local VoG election, which was higher than previous attempts by Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats.\n \n\n\n\n Now the party is looking to recruit new volunteers to build and operate local branches and contribute to holding our devolved government to account.\n \n\n\n\n ---\n   \n\n About Pirate Party UK\n \n\n\n\n The Pirate Party in the UK is a fledgling political party. It has fielded a few candidates in European and National elections, but like most small parties it is significantly constrained by the UK electoral system. Despite this, the Pirate Party has started to poll alongside major parties and is looking to build support from the grassroots. The party stood 10 candidates in the June 2017 General Election, and continually polls higher at each election.\n \n\n\n\n Find out more about the UK Pirate Party at\n <https://pirateparty.org.uk/>\n or contact\n [[email\u00a0protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "\n\n\n If you live in Wales, are aged 11-18 and want to take part in the Welsh Youth Parliament you will not be allowed to disclose your party affiliation.\n \n\n\n\n The Welsh Government announced the end to their consultation in November 2017 and have decided on the particulars surrounding the Welsh Youth Parliament, despite never publishing the results of the consultation.\n \n\n\n\n Those aged 11-18 are permitted to take part, the first elections will be November 2018 and there will be 60 members but none are allowed to disclose their party association(s).

We need Pirates now more than ever to stop this super-national threat to our freedom online.\n \n\n\n\n Pirate Party Acting Leader David A Elston said:\n \n\n\n\n \"The misleading counter-campaign \"\n [The Link is Safe](https://twitter.com/MagazineMedia/status/829248407436980224) \n \" maintains that democracy will be empowered if Big Media is allowed to further weaponise copyright and make it even more restrictive.\n \n\n\n\n \"We've seen from\n [previous attempts](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/07/new-study-shows-spains-google-tax-has-been-a-disaster-for-publishers/) \n at implementing this tax in Spain and Germany that it is actually\n [highly damaging to the news industry](http://the-digital-reader.com/2014/10/22/german-publishers-cave-grant-google-free-permission-use-snippets-search-results/) \n as a whole, with small publishers being forced to bear the brunt of the costs which result from it.\n \n\n\n\n \"This is to say nothing of the damage it would cause to the free and open internet, where the ability to share links to content underpins almost everything we do online.\n \n\n\n\n \"The EU Copyright Directive and its proposals are based on the misguided notion that creative works have to be owned by someone, and that this person must therefore control who can copy said works. In reality, copyright has not been used to protect individual authors for a long time, but is instead used to drown out and limit competition.\n \n\n\n\n \"Sharing works does not prevent the authors from making more works, but actually exposes them to more people who would pay for it. Until some time ago this was merely based on individual experiences but finally \"Pirates\" were proven to pay over the odds for content as opposed to traditional purchasers by an Ofcom report in 2013.\"\n \n\n\n\n If you've not seen it yet, Julia Reda, Pirate Party MEP, opens the\n \n[#SaveTheLink](https://twitter.com//search?q=%23SaveTheLink) \n video\n [here](https://youtu.be/TKf4Mkp93-c) \n .\n \n\n\n\n ---\n \n\n\n\n About Pirate Party UK\n \n\n\n\n The\u00a0 Pirate Party in the UK is a fledgling political party.

Very few people have not spoken about Brexit, the Tory leadership race, the Labour PLP and leadership, the Icelandic election or more recently the US election. I have been interested in politics for a number of years, and a Pirate party member since around the General Election of 2015.\u00a02016 however, has truly inspired me, due to this sudden interest that most of my friends,colleagues and acquaintances have now developed. I dream that the typical apathy and lack of wanting to vote for thinking that \"things never change\"\u00a0mind-set is starting to fall away. I hope that perhaps realisation that the First Past The Post system is what gives us the static system of government generally and is equally what divides us.\n \n\n\n\n Some people wondered why the \u201closing\u201d side to Brexit or the US Elections complained, moaned and did not accept the result. This is quite simple when you boil it down to the fact both were only a binary choice question, this is clearly going to be divisive by nature!\n \n\n\n\n Our First Past The Post system is doing the same, \u00a0whilst the share of the two main parties vote in the UK decreased by some 30% in the last 60 years it has only\u00a0effected\u00a0seat number by approximatley 13%.\n \n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170614115543im_/http://i.imgur.com/eTpJQJM.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n Imagine that Proportional Representation was brought into being for our votes, firstly I feel the decline in voters generally would change dramatically as votes would count far more than ever. I also think that the two party dominance would very much change as people vote for who they truly want, rather than opposing who they want least.\n \n\n\n\n So whilst this research done for the 2015 General election shows that this\u00a0was the result under the current First Past The Post\n \n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170614115543im_/http://i.imgur.com/yjsV2uf.png)\n\n\n\n\n and\u00a0this would be under Proportional Representation.\n \n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170614115543im_/http://i.imgur.com/v7TOvDk.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How might this have changed if those that voted for Labour because they did not want Tories and vice-versa could vote for a party they might actually agree with instead?!\n \n\n\n\n I for one feel now is the time that people would consider an alternative, they would \u201cThink different\u201d and maybe \u201cVote different\u201d too!\n \n\n\n\n Also with other considerations coming into the limelight far more, with people suddenly getting concerned about digital privacy with the likes of Trump and the KKK possible advisors, of course our civil liberties start to appeal to more and more people. Another topic I feel will come more to attention over the next couple of years is the Universal Basic Income, with more and more automation there is only so many jobs that can go around, and once all the immigrants can no longer be blamed for this, people will start to wake up to the real reasons, rather than those fed through the media and look for answers.\n \n\n\n\n I personally have some more free time on my hands and as such now wish to get far more involved in the party and help out to do more going forward. I travel a lot with Work all over the \u201cSouth West\u201d including south Wales down to Bournemouth on the Coast.

We then had an open discussion of the film and the IPBill with a panel including Gary Herman from the National Union of Journalists, Gary Hough from Zen Internet, Loz Kaye from Open Intelligence, and myself.\n \n\n\n\n While recognising the threats posed by terrorism, paedophilia, and organised crime, the room seemed unanimous in its belief that the IPBill is poorly conceived, lacking in detail, and over-reaching in its powers. For some background on the IPBill see\n <https://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Investigatory_Powers_Bill>\n .\n \n\n\n\n Many significant questions were raised during the meeting about the practicality of the bill. The concerns included:\n \n\n\n* Can the powers described in the bill be technically achieved?\n* Can the data collected be held securely and what would happen if it were to fall into the hands of organised crime?\n* Who will pay to implement the data collection and storage?\n* Will searches of the data yield meaningful results or will there be a disproportionate number of 'false positives'?\n* What impact will the bill have on the Internet and on society at large?\n\n\n\n One important additional question is \"how did we get here?\" It seems likely that we have boxed our politicians into a corner: when there is a bad news story (such as a terrorist attack), we, or the Press supposedly on our behalves, demand to know why it wasn't prevented. The politicians, therefore, go to the security services and police and ask what tools they want in order to ensure it doesn't happen again. And, of course, this puts the spies and law enforcers in a tight spot because now they will be held responsible, so they obviously ask for strong powers. Pervasive bulk surveillance is just one of the arrows they demand for their quiver.\n \n\n\n\n But, as noted in The Haystack, \"In a free society you cannot secure every restaurant.\" And as the meeting at ORG agreed, even though the proposed powers may be dramatically extensive, they may turn out to be only the thin end of a very large wedge that turns the UK into a police state.\n \n\n\n\n Fear of erroneous accusations based on \"correlation of data points\" already influences how people express their opinions online. Those who feel vulnerable or threatened will tend to keep their heads down, and this has a chilling effect on participation in democracy and debate.\n \n\n\n\n So what can we do about it?\n \n\n\n\n It seems essential to say \"no\" loudly and clearly. But in the new post-referendum world it is highly unclear how we can influence our politicians \u2013 indeed, it is pretty unclear which of our politicians we need to influence as they engage in their own massive game of musical chairs!\n \n\n\n\n Certainly this is not the time for online petitions, a mass mailing of postcards, or a protest march. While these might show the volume of opposition, they have a low threshold to participation and are largely ignored by our representatives. In any case, they are likely to be swamped in the current noise around the referendum result. Furthermore, such ways of lobbying can even be counter-productive as MPs frequently point out that only a small fraction of the electorate has objected.\n \n\n\n\n So what we need to do is return to traditional means of lobbying. We need to be polite and informative. We need to visit our MPs and to write them letters that are concise and relevant. In short, we need convince them of our arguments.\n \n\n\n\n Only four weeks ago, my MP implied to me that we had no reason to worry about the IPBill because the powers it created would only be used by our elected Government and we all know we can completely trust our Government to do the right thing. But now, just a short time later, we have no idea who will lead our parties in the Commons, we have an Opposition with no shadow ministers responsible for Justice (Lord Falconer and Karl Turner having jumped out of the plane). We also have a startling rise of racist incidents on our streets, and pressure from the political right wing to have more of a say. Now is surely not the best time to be creating such a surveillance state.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["IPBill", "#IPBill", "Surveillance", "Monitoring", "ORG", "Adrian Farrel", "Snoopers Charter"], "source": [], "url": "https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/adrian-farrel/what-price-security-surveillance-now", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170609224352/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/adrian-farrel/what-price-security-surveillance-now", "date": "2016-06-26T21:26:37+01:00"}, "/blogs/david-elston/leaders-update-saferinternetday-2016": {"state": "full", "title": "Leader's Update: #SaferInternetDay 2016", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n[#SaferInternetDay](https://twitter.com//search?q=%23SaferInternetDay) \n is a mixed day for Pirates.

This particular image shows the tiny figure of a hiker by the Stoodley Pike Monument (built in the time of the 1800s' disputes about commons enclosure) on Langfield Common, from the vantage point of a road forming the boundary on the other side of the valley.

Well, it would not mean a lot if you had infinite demand. The thing is, although our population including the proportion of them which is connected to the net is increasing very fast, very fast does not an infinity make. The only thing limiting supply of information on the internet is the appetite to take it, the demand (and a few doomed artificial demand modifiers such as repressive dictatorships, TPP,\n [TTIP](/tags/ttip) \n and so forth). The price of information has not just dropped to zero, it has become negative.

The reason\n [Google](http://www.google.co.uk/) \n is so big is because it found a way to couple your attention with a useful service, searching through that vast supply of information. However, as search itself is now an infinitely available type of information, Google is only still existent by its own\n [inertia](http://www.ehow.com/info_8296792_corporate-inertia.html) \n , and the same goes for all companies that try to profit from information this way.

Not only does the information come to these publishers through the compounded efforts of science too thick and fast to print, such that this information is basically free, but because of wanting to filter which information they present based on their own flawed (by way of '\n [prestige](http://www.universalrejection.org/) \n ', arbitration with the potential for bias and artificial capacity limitations) idea of what the world at large needs to see with their official name put to it, these publishers charge scientists to be printed. And I don't want to kill peer review as a credible, unbiased system of information dissemination;\n [publishers have already done that](/blog/george-walkden/case-open-access) \n . \u201cYou have an informational (near-) infinity? You'll have to pay us to shift it\u201d. Now that seems fair enough, but what you DON'T then do is charge for the distribution of that information on the other side as if your filtration is somehow more valid than that of your reader-customers. You have basically acknowledged that the price of information is LESS THAN ZERO, so HOW DARE YOU CHARGE TWICE for it? Even eBay, classic intermediaries (and up for\n [disintermediation themselves](https://voluntary.net/bitmarkets/) \n ), don't charge twice for the same sale, they place the fee on the buyer OR the seller's side, not both. If you, the scientific publishers, are charging people to buy your infinitely reproducible PDFs, it is only out of trying to create an artificial bottleneck in the supply and not out of a natural limitation. History teaches us that time and again, such bottlenecks are\n [always](http://www.futurama-madhouse.net/scripts/5acv02.shtml) \n[doomed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Even the 'series of tubes' analogy of the internet is flawed, as it suggests a limited capacity. Funny, given that the cable company keep just dialling the speed on up on those same copper cables they always had. These tubes don't keep growing wider, there's just someone sat on the taps. Why are there even taps? Well, I'm sure you can tell from the rest of this article what I am saying about ISPs. The thing is, again, we will [various links to decentralised internet systems eg.

In effect, a patent is an acknowledgement of the infinite availability of information, be it printed or electronic, and then sets a time limit to the inventor to have control over the use of their design so that they have half a chance to make it do what they want it to do. IT IS NOT a cash cow, IT IS NOT a monopoly to extend as long as you can get away with, and IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FOR SALE. If the original inventor no longer needs a particular patent, it should become public domain, an open patent, because to sell it is to presume gains from something unproven and is to place a value on information that DECREASES its actual worth (and\n [drug patents kill people](/tags/drug-patents) \n ). If you actually drop the selfishness and think of the survival and prosperity of everybody collectively,\n \n\n\n\n INFORMATION IS WORTH FAR MORE TO US FREE THAN IT IS BEHIND A PAYWALL.\n \n\n\n\n If you want to make a living off making information available, you can cover the ACTUAL COST of that work a little with with donations, but far more with the INFORMATION THAT YOU GET IN RETURN. Everyone who takes part in the internet contributes to it, and cat memes are just as important as cancer-curing science, because who are you to judge whether that cat meme didn't just brighten someone's day enough to prevent a tragedy? The internet needs humour and 'pointless' things. There is a demand, so there is a supply. And because of how the internet connects us all using machines that can copy data infinitely, that is an infinite supply at the same cost to the information's creator as sending the data to one other person.\n \n\n\n\n It is therefore economic common sense that several of the industries we prop up today with our continued patronage are unsustainable, their perceived worth is another bubble and it will pop. We need to get off this drug of artificially restricting our own vital supplies just to feel the buzz of seeing someone get rich, because what is a profit forecast based on sale of information but an artificial bottleneck under construction? Or to put it in medieval terms, it is\n [inclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure) \n of the commons. Things that are available to all ought not be fenced off. Because these (data) commons are infinitely large, this means the industries of this world are virtually building a fence around the people, trapping us in their drip-fed factory-farm so they can milk us for our cash, and feeding to us at a price the ideas and imagination we are so being denied the ability to create for ourselves, through an illusion that anything that costly must be difficult to think of or do! Look at the amazing James Dyson, Richard Branson and Elon Musk! Shh! Don't tell anybody that they actually have the ability to think more freely than any of those people themselves, they might just rise to the challenge!\n \n\n\n\n BUT ISN'T THAT COMMUNISM?\n \n\n\n\n Not like any communism I've ever heard of in practise. Seriously, has genuine communism ever existed on this planet? Even if it did, it would be a flawed notion, because it misses the voluntary aspect out. Communism as we know it isn't what it was supposed to be because it isn't possible for it to work the way it was intended. Instead, it's dictatorships with massive control apparatuses. Capitalism as we know it isn't what it was supposed to be either, it too is a form of\n [soft dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictablanda) \n with control apparatuses formed from the corporations. If we had true free markets and if we had true communism, the two would bring us to the same thing!\n \n\n\n\n VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONISM.\n \n\n\n\n Funnily enough, with the advent of cryptocurrencies and peer to peer everything, we are getting to a point now where we can start to circumvent these bottlenecks and inclosures not one at a time, but en masse. The true value of infinite information is not just that it is free due to quantity, but that it sets us all free. The only people who control what information gets on the internet should be the original sources, and the only means of information control should be the private, un-tampered-with individual choice of what is converted one way or another from thought to publicly available. Not money, not secret police silencing people, not extortion or threats, not violence or propaganda, not your government, not your 'boss' (what an old fashioned notion), and not that horrible thing that leaches common sense, 'reputation'! Your reputation is only any good if it speaks the truth, warts and all, and includes those times when people got the wrong end of the stick, rather than hides them. If you manipulate it, you have lost it already. Like all other information, it needs to be free from inclosure.\n [Blockchains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_%28database%29) \n and peer to peer cryptocurrencies allow people a way to escape the reputation-laden system to a means of transacting and interacting without the need for trust whilst money and power are still involved.\n \n\n\n\n This does not mean we cannot work together. This does not mean we cannot have companies. This does not mean we cannot persuade one another to unite around common goals to make big ideas happen. It just means it's high time we learn to respect intellectual commons as the common good they do, not as property. Property is a physical object or other thing that can only be made once and that is impossible to duplicate infinitely without infinite cost. Yes, data does cost something to duplicate, in the use of electricity and the eventual replacement of computer equipment and in storage, that's why it is now of negative monetary value. We have so much of it we don't know what to do with it all. But that cost of duplication is a cost to the end user, not to the author, so it's high time authors recognised that they get their value back from the other free information out there and publishers step out of the way altogether as unnecessary intermediaries. What we need instead now are\n [curators](http://virtualchristine.com/tag/arcadia-asylum-living-library/) \n , not as guardians of inclosure or reputation, but as unobstructive collectors and sharers of interesting combinations, to find new meanings and ideas and to be inventors themselves. Want a model for civilised sharing and contributions? Look to\n [Opensimulator](http://www.opensimulator.org/) \n . We have been simulating free society there for years. It works.

Read on for some tips and observations about why people fail to vote in practice.\n \n\n\n\n\n The electoral register is managed at a local level.\u00a0 Most people are registered because the council sends a form to their house, and they fill in the details and return the form in the post.\u00a0 If you have not moved from the address where you were registered before, chances are your details will be pre-printed on the form, and all you need to do is to confirm the details are correct.\u00a0 If not, then add your details.\u00a0 It is the law that these forms must be completed correctly.\u00a0 Of course, punishment is rare, but the important thing is that if you share a house, there is a legal right for you to have your name included on the form.\u00a0 Nobody has the right to deny your registration to vote.\n \n\n\n\n Nobody needs to wait for the council's letter in order to register.\u00a0 People can just write directly to the council to register, at any time of year.\u00a0 This is important because some people will move around during the year, and will want to change where they vote.\u00a0 Lots of people forget to re-register at their new address, and then either have to travel to vote, or else they miss out completely.\u00a0 There is a very useful feature on the aboutmyvote website that tells you who to register with, based on your postcode.\n \n\n\n\n Students should beware on missing out on their vote.\u00a0 Because they move around more than other people do, they may not receive a polling card as expected, and hence lots of students miss out on exercising their democratic right.\u00a0 Students may be registered at their old digs or at their parents' house.\u00a0 If you are a student, try to remember to re-register if you move, and think carefully about whether you need a postal vote or want to travel to vote in your parents' constituency if you are still registered there.\n \n\n\n\n People can register as young as 16, even though they cannot vote until aged 18.\u00a0 The reason for this is to ensure that nobody misses out because of delays in registration - if the election is held the same day as your 18th birthday, you have the right to vote on that day.\n \n\n\n\n People living overseas also tend to miss out more than most.\u00a0 If you are a UK citizen living abroad, but were registered to vote at a UK address in the last 15 years, you can still vote in UK elections by registering at that old address.\u00a0 There are also postal votes and votes by proxy, so you can vote even if you are outside the UK on the day of the election.\u00a0 Again, all the details for people about eligible overseas voters can be found at the aboutmyvote website.\n \n\n\n\n One important thing to note is that you should not leave it too late to register.\u00a0 It obviously takes councils time and money to update their register, so do not wait until the election is called and then try to be added to the electoral roll.\n \n\n\n\n The party is forming now, and it is a priority that we give good information to supporters on how to register and how to vote, so we can maximize the number of votes we get.\u00a0 One thing to think about is that some people may have a choice of where in the country they register; as we will not be able to field candidates in every seat, when we announce where we will be competing, you may want to re-register so you can vote in those constituencies.\u00a0 Do not delay in registering to vote.\u00a0 Although most commentators expect the election will be April next year, it might be this autumn.\u00a0 In the coming weeks it will be a priority for the party and the youth wing to include on the website some good useful information on how to register, because it is a question we get a lot, and I will be regularly reminding people of the need to register - so apologies to those of you who do not need reminding.\u00a0 Your vote is important, do not lose it!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["voter registration"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/registering-vote", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170111201830/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/registering-vote", "date": "2009-08-27T00:00:00+01:00"}, "/press/icelandic-pirates-asked-form-government": {"state": "summery_only", "summery": "<div class=\"views-field views-field-body\">\n <div class=\"field-content\">\n  <p>\n   Almost a month after the most successful elections for any national Pirate Party, the Icelandic Pirate Party has been formally asked to try and form a Government after both the 2 largest parties failed to do so.

As I am sure that you realise with a number of people stepping down from the NEC without people stepping up to replace them, it left a void at the top of the party for the last few months. However, with a New Year comes a New Start - and as a party we appear to have done that classic tech admin thing of 'turn it off and turn it back on again' with a fair degree of success.\n   \n\n  \n\n As far as members go - we have beaten our previous high and as of 31-Dec had over 760 members - so thanks to each and every one of you for supporting the party and getting involved. One of our plans for the year ahead is to have a much more distributed workload and to utilise volunteers much more - having a distributed support means that we really need to use that to our advantage, so get in touch to see how you can get involved.\n   \n\n  \n\n One of the ways in which to get involved is to join the NEC, the group which coordinates and plans the work of the party. There are vacancies in a number of roles:\n   \n\n  \n\n If you want to head our policy co-ordination and the inner workings of the party, then consider putting yourself forward for Party Secretary. An essential role to keep the party's terms of service and privacy policy true.\n   \n\n  \n\n Our Treasurer position is also available; one of the most valued functions to fulfil in a party. If you can handle the responsibility of procurement of campaign materials and keeping finances in order is your strength, you would be worth your weight in gold to Pirates.\n   \n\n  \n\n Even the Party Leader position is open to nominations, if leadership is your style. As Party Leader, you'd be the figurehead of the Party, acting as a point of contact to the media whilst also overseeing the operations of the NEC.\n   \n\n  \n\n For more detail on the NEC positions available, take a look at the NEC code of practice[1]\n   \n\n  \n\n David A Elston\n   \n\n Pirate Party Deputy Leader\n   \n\n  \n\n [1]\n [https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/nec-code-practice](/nec-code-practice) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["Leaders Update", "Vacancies", "NEC", "Volunteers", "David A Elston"], "source": [], "url": "http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/david-elston/leaders-update-2016-call-action", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161201073143/http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/david-elston/leaders-update-2016-call-action", "date": "2016-01-26T13:51:20+00:00"}, "/press/party-backs-votesat16": {"state": "full", "title": "Party Backs #VotesAt16", "body": "\n\n\n\n Pirate Party backs\n \n[#VotesAt16](https://twitter.com//search?q=%23VotesAt16) \n in the EU referendum and future elections\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n Today, the House of Commons blocked a Lords amendment to lower the voting age\u00a0 to 16 for the forthcoming EU referendum.

Raising funds is vital to determining how many seats we can fight, but there is every likelihood that we will need to focus our energies on particular seats instead of trying to fight too many and losing a lot of deposits. That makes it absolutely vital that we make the best choice of which seats to fight. However, for a party concerned with information politics, we lack some of the information we would like. We can speculate about where we might get the most votes, but without polling data, it will be a guess. For example, university towns often get cited as likely targets. On the other hand, most PPUK members are too old to be students, and if the membership is representative of our voters we must have plenty of support off campus as well as on.\n \n\n\n\n\n Some suggest a different kind of strategy.\u00a0 We could compete with certain kinds of high profile MPs. For example, we could run against unpopular MPs who abused their expenses. Another suggestion is to focus on marginals. In a close race, the switch of votes to PPUK could change the result and hence magnify the press attention for the party. It will also make the other parties take our issues seriously, which is a key goal.\n \n\n\n\n There is one thing we know without needing to speculate or hypothesize about strategy - where our members are. This is important, as fighting elections cannot be done through national media coverage and internet campaigning alone. We need volunteers out on the streets, supporting our candidate. As you might expect, we have most supporters in the biggest towns. Looking a little more deeply, we can see clusters of members in slightly smaller towns, giving us a better concentration of potentially active campaigners. York, Cambridge, St. Albans and Leicester all have relatively high numbers of PPUK members, suggesting we should prioritize them in the search for target seats. Looking a little bigger, PPUK also has relative dense pockets of support in Edinburgh and Leeds. As you would expect, there are many members in London, so we can take advantage of the density of the population and aim to fight several seats in the capital. Between now and election day, the most important thing is to develop the teams on the ground, and if it looks like there is a fabulous group of supporters in the constituency of Ross, Skye and Lochaber or in Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, then that would be a very good reason to run candidates there.\n \n\n\n\n The other thing currently unknown is the quality and location of our best prospective candidates. But we can all work to solve that problem. We are not a party of careerist politicians like Labour or the Conservatives, who parachute in favoured candidates into their safest seats, irrespective of the fact that their candidate has hardly any connection with the people they are supposed to represent. Even the Greens have gone down that route, by handing their most winnable seat to their party leader. Unlike other parties with established hierarchies, PPUK needs popular and charismatic individuals to step forward, and not wait to be approached. Individuals with the skills, passion and commitment to convey the importance of pirate politics to a sometimes sceptical world cannot afford to wait for the party to find them or wait for a process to officially pick candidates, as we will only know where to fight based on the data we have. Likely candidates need to make themselves known and to come to the fore now, and to do so by building the local teams of supporters. Think of it like this: who would make the better candidate out of an individual who persuades a dozen friends to form a constituency party and start active campaigning, or somebody who hopes that fellow pirates will get the ball rolling in their region? We do not have a selection process yet, but I believe a good selection process would recognize the efforts made to launch and build local teams of supporters who will be the ones doing the legwork come election day.\u00a0 It is not long until the next general election, so let us all take the initiative and build a party that can pose a real challenge on election day!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["GE2010"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/finding-candidates-and-targets", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170112021414/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/finding-candidates-and-targets", "date": "2009-09-20T00:00:00+01:00"}, "/blog/editor/building-strong-political-party": {"state": "full", "title": "Building a strong political party", "body": "\n\n\n\n When we sent off our party registration form to the Electoral Commission less than a dozen weeks ago, we were all absolute beginners at running a political party. We elected 4 officers, because there were 4 officer jobs to be filled in on that form. We've come a very, very long way in a few short weeks, with more media coverage than we could have hoped for, and as officers, we've learned a lot about how a political party works. We've had our share of teething troubles, as you might expect from any group of volunteers, but we've learned a lot of lessons too, and we now have a much clearer picture of how much interest there is in the Pirate Party UK, and what needs to be done to turn this large group of\u00a0 interested people into a fully functioning political party capable of contesting major elections ... and that's what I'm blogging about today.\n \n\n\n\n\n The 4 officer roles that the Electoral Commission required us to fill in on that form were chosen by the Electoral Commission because they need to know who to send letters to, not because it takes exactly 4 people to run a party. In reality, the role of 'Treasurer' is so large that it requires a team of people. On the other hand the role of Nominating officer is (at it's core) just one of filling in forms when an election comes. The role of Leader is perhaps the most vaguely defined of all. As you might expect from the largest political party on Facebook, we have reached the stage where we need to expand the team of people who have formal roles in the party. The system of elections we used to pick our officers relied on a month-long vote, but the pressing need to expand the structure of the party means we need a faster process for new appointments, because we can't afford to be unprepared for the General Election. We have had some appointments by default, such as Gavin the web hero, but that's not really a grown-up process for a grown-up party.\n \n\n\n\n From now on, our process for handing out non-officer jobs will consist of appointment and ratification by member votes. The leader and officers have the power to appoint people to roles, and these appointments will start immediately, but be subject to a vote of members, who can say no to any appointment, and their decision will be binding. Today, I'm announcing the first few appointments, and forum votes to ratify these appointments will be set up shortly. I'm proud to announce that Peter Liddell has been appointed as deputy treasurer responsible for membership and donations. John Prescott as deputy treasurer responsible for \u00a0budgeting, and WilliamFS as manifesto co-ordinator. This last job is a very important one, William will be responsible for the ongoing process taking the results from the policy working groups and turning them into a solid, coherent, well-written manifesto that we can present to voters. This is no simple task, WiIliam will be responsible for the process of organising member votes to ratify all our policies, to ensure that our manifesto will be (perhaps uniquely among major parties) entirely democratically decided by party members. If you are reading this and you are not yet a member, this is your cue to sign up so you can vote! We are a very new party and therefore inevitably very short of funds. Income from membership fees is absolutely vital to pay the \u00a3500 deposit per constituency that is required if we are going to give the people of the UK the chance to vote pirate.\n \n\n\n\n We are actively looking to appoint people to several other roles. Gavin is stepping down from his role in charge of the webteam because he doesn't have enough spare time to devote to the job, and we will ratify his replacement soon. There is a strong candidate for the job of running the Youth Pirates, but we need to draw up a job spec before ratifying that appointment. Philip Hunt has been doubling up as Press Officer as well as carrying his registered role as\u00a0 Campaigns Officer, but the now that burden is too great for one volunteer, so we intend splitting the two jobs. We have had preliminary conversations with candidates with suitable qualifications and experience to perform the roles of Press Officer and Deputy Press Officers, and expect to appoint people very soon.\n \n\n\n\n We have had some problems with discipline in the party. Again, we are only just starting out, so this is to be expected as we have inevitable clashes between ideologies and clashes between personalities. I'm not going to rake over the coals here, and I'm also (despite a lot of pressure) not going to make public any of the private discussions I've had with the members and officers concerned. I'm simply going to state the outcome of one high profile case that affects the running of the party, and ask the membership to take my word that this is the best solution. Our Nominating Officer John 'rancidpunk' Mckeown and our Treasurer Eric Priezkalns had a public falling out. As a result, both of them tendered their resignations. As leader, \u00a0I'm convinced that without both of them, this party would be much weaker, so my decision is as follows: \u00a0As part of the party formation process, we were required to submit a party constitution for the Electoral Commission to approve, and in it we laid the foundations for governing a bigger party than one with just 4 officers. The structure laid out in that constitution consists of a national executive committee voted for by members. Initially, the people voted in as officers are the members of the executive committee. I have therefore accepted John's resignation as Nominating Officer, but he will remain a member of the executive committee, and he will formally take on the invaluable role he has informally been doing for a wile now, which is leading our team of forum moderators. I have also accepted Eric's resignation as Treasurer in principle, but he will remain in that role until he has found a suitable replacement, and he will also remain a member of the executive committee, where his excellent management and organisational skills can be used in a less public-facing position. This leaves us without a Nominating Officer, and an election will therefore be held for that role. In the interim, I will take on the formal form-filling part of that job, which will be a trivial task provided the general election is not called early.\n \n\n\n\n I realise that this, and the appointment system outlined above, may not be popular with all our members, but I must emphasise that this is my final decision. In the run up to the election, we cannot afford to be torn apart by internal bickering, we cannot afford to lose dedicated supporters of the party, and we cannot afford to be completely idealistic about procedures given the immovable deadline.

She still can't have the radio on at work, or play CDs that she's paid for at work, but she can now sing.\n \n\n\n\n It's tempting to look at this and declare it a victory for common sense, but the fact remains that under our legal system the PRS still have the legal right to 'double dip' by charging radio stations and radio listeners twice for the same thing, they still have the legal right to threaten shop workers for singing without a licence while stacking shelves, and they still have the right to force businesses to ban their staff from listening to radios.

Gary, Janis and even the UK government acknowledges that Gary's crime was committed here in the UK, yet inexplicably the UK government calls itself 'powerless' to prevent Gary being carted to the US to face a disproportionate penalty. Pathetic words of sympathy are offered by Sarah Brown, the PM's wife, but what good will they do? What the government refuses to admit is that it is far from powerless. It just chooses not to act. Britain is a sovereign state. If the government permitted time, our parliament could change the law.\n \n\n\n\n\n Treaties signed with foreign governments can be torn up or renegotiated. It just suits our government to appease the US and spare their blushes after Gary, a man chasing after UFOs, showed just how lame US national security really is. The extradition itself is delayed for the moment, nominally to review Gary's medical condition, but most probably as a tactic by the government to avoid further anti-Labour publicity in the run up to the Glasgow NE by-election. With that by-election due to be held in a few days, Gary may have very little time left in the UK. If you want to help lobby our leaders to stop Gary's extradition, time is short.\n \n\n\n\n Janis' next move is to speak at a\n [Homes Affairs Select Committee meeting](http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/home_affairs_committee.cfm) \n to be held this Tuesday, 10th November between 5pm and 6pm. The meeting will be held at Portcullis House, located on Victoria Embankment. Here is a suggestion to all pirates who will be anywhere near Victoria Embankment on Tuesday afternoon. Go to the meeting. Select committee meetings are open to the public. For general information about attending select committee meetings, look\n [here](http://www.parliament.uk/visiting/attend/committees.cfm) \n . Home Secretary Alan Johnson will be making his excuses for the one-sided extradition treaty agreed with a US government supposedly worried about terrorism - though nobody thinks Gary is a terrorist. You will not get the chance to speak, but Alan Johnson will see you there. A big turnout will prove that British citizens care about Gary's plight and that we think the law is wrong.\n \n\n\n\n We know that Keith Vaz, Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, believes the law can and should be changed. Go down and give the TV cameras more people to film than they are used to. Go down and encourage MPs like Vaz to keep pressuring the government for change, before it is too late for Gary. With the US and other governments saying they can pass laws that apply to anyone on the internet, wherever they are, nobody knows what the next extradition injustice might be, unless we tighten those extradition rules now.\n \n\n\n\n If you cannot make it down to attend the select committee meeting, do not forget to show support by joining the\n [Facebook group in support of Gary](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2263327633) \n .

Is you ringing your partner or family telling them you forgot to pick up the milk a matter of life and death? Under DRIP it is, and you need to be recorded.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**This law is set to be pushed through under emergency powers.** \n\n\n\n\n The \"emergency\" is not about a real concrete danger to you. The real emergency is about the government undermining our fundamental rights. David Cameron has said it is about harm to UK citizens. It is David Cameron who is harming UK citizens by taking our rights way.\n \n\n\n\n We are asking you to ring or email your Member of Parliament and let us know how it went.\n \n\n\n### \n DRIP will undermine human rights\n\n\n\n The starting point for the latest attack on our privacy rights was a ruling by the European Court of Justice back in April. Blanket surveillance was found to interfere \"in a particularly serious manner with the fundamental rights to respect private life and to the protection of personal data\".\n \n\n\n\n This was because mass surveillance is about every communication between anyone,\n *even if they are not even indirectly suspected of any crime* \n . This is obviously disproportionate.\n \n\n\n### \n DRIP was a stitch up between the 3 main parties behind closed doors\n\n\n\n Following the Snowden revelations, all parties are now well aware that any law to do with data and surveillance is an important issue for many voters. Even so, the Conservatives, Labour and LibDems put a deal together in secret without involving the public. In fact, the first even many MPs knew about this deal was a splash in the Sun newspaper. Our democracy deserves better than this.\n \n\n\n### \n DRIP tightens the grip of mass surveillance - DRIP will extend surveillance powers\n\n\n\n The government has claimed this is just a continuation of the same powers they already have. In fact,\n \n[#DRIP](https://twitter.com//search?q=%23DRIP) \n significantly extends the scope of RIPA interception warrants, so they can be used against ISPs based outside the UK, as well as against almost any organisation providing online services. Many legal experts have said they are concerned it opens up the extent and intent of UK surveillance. We deserve proper debate and scrutiny on these powers.\n \n\n\n### \n DRIP will be forced through with no proper scrutiny in a week\n\n\n\n The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill is due to be pushed through Parliament in less than a week. Data law is notoriously difficult and there are always many objections. It's only fair that this is properly looked at, not rushed through to work around MP's holidays. The timetable has not given constituents enough time to look through and discuss it with their members of parliament. Even an MP like Julian Huppert has admitted that he doesn't know the full implication of what parliament is supposed to be agreeing.\n \n\n\n### \n ACTION\n\n\n\n Please get in touch with your MP, and let us know how it goes.\n \n\n\n\n Please share this page, and use the hashtag\n \n[#DRIP](https://twitter.com//search?q=%23DRIP) \n .\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": [], "source": [], "url": "http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/campaigns/issues/stop-drip", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160502234122/http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/campaigns/issues/stop-drip"}, "/press/pirate-party-uk-adopts-security-certificates-lets-encrypt": {"state": "full", "title": "Pirate Party UK Adopts Security Certificates from Let's Encrypt", "body": "\n\n\n\n The Pirate Party recognises the importance of Web encryption to protect personal and business information that flow over the Internet.

If you want to be able to VOTE PIRATE in your area, then why not consider standing as a candidate for your local council? You can find out more about what it involves here -\n <https://pirateparty.org.uk/standing-election-your-local-council>\n\n\n\n\n In\u00a0 2014 we stood in the North-West Region for the European Elections. At last year's General Election we had candidates in Manchester, Sheffield, South Wales and London. This year we want to consolidate in those areas, and branch out to new ones as well. This means that even if you are the only Pirate in your area it's still worth standing as a candidate as a\u00a0 way of putting the Pirate name and brand out there - hopefully it will lead to kick-starting a branch in your area if people come forward and are interested.\n \n\n\n\n Please do get in touch with the Nominations team (\n [nominations@pirateparty.org.uk](mailto:nominations@pirateparty.org.uk) \n ) to put your name forward or just to find out more about the opportunities in your area - standing for your local council is the least onerous of all candidatures. Don't forget you will get central party support, so if you are new to elections and time is short, we can help you. If you can help us to get the Pirate symbol on your local Ballot Paper and broaden the number of people we can reach, then we will help you become a strong Pirate candidate!\n \n\n\n\n As a way of leading by example - former Nominating Officer and previous EU Candidate, George Walkden, is standing in a local council by-election in Higher Blackley, Manchester.

Piratecon was held in Marianske Lazne, a Pirate stronghold in the Bohemia region of the Czech Republic. Marianske Lazne is run by a coalition council, with a Pirate majority, and even has a Pirate mayor! The conference was focussed on sharing knowledge between Pirate parties from all over Europe and was attended by Pirate VIPs includiong Julia Reda MEP and Rick Falkvinge himself! Cris gave a talk about the state of the UK political climate, his experiences running in the UK general election, and then went on to talk about using Bitcoin as being a key part of his campaign platform. He was followed by his campaign manager Rebecca Rae who gave a full breakdown of the PPUK Gorton campaign strategy and results.\n \n\n\n\n Cris said:\n *\"It was great to be able to attend this conference, hear from Pirates all over Europe about their successes and failures, and share tactics for success. A great deal of the countries that were represented had Pirates in local council, which I think is a great start; more direct forms of democracy - including our particular brand of bringing democracy closer to the people - can really shine when it comes to local politics, where people can connect with their representatives in a very immediate way, and see immediate feedback. It was also great to meet people like Julia and Falkvinge; I had the unique pleasure of spending a few hours talking to Julia Reda about copyright; her depth of knowledge and passion on the subject is - unsurprisingly - quite extraordinary. We came away really inspired and ready to make a real difference.\"* \n\n\n\n\n**Standing for the Party - local council by-elections** \n\n\n\n\n As Cris alludes to above, one of the things that we have somewhat failed at in the UK in contrast to Pirate Parties across Europe is the election of Pirate candidates at even a local level. Partly this is due to electoral systems - First Past the Post is really problematic for small parties standing for the first time. Equally however, you could argue that it is because we haven't even been on the ballot paper, and so have been falling at the first hurdle. This is something that we really want to try and improve on over the next few years - but for us to stand, we really need people willing to have their names on a ballot paper. There are by-elections for councillors on local councils every week - at present I am aware of vacancies and upcoming by-elections from Camborne in Cornwall, to Shotton in Durham, from Caerphilly to Aberdeen and myriad places inbetween. By my reckoning, on average, every local authority has a by-election at least once a year - so chances are that you could be a Pirate candidate somewhen in the next 12 months!\n \n\n\n\n In order to stand as a candidate there are a couple of very simple requirements - you need to prove a connection to the local authority (usually by living or working there), and (in England and Wales, but not in Scotland) you need to get 10 'eligible voters' in the ward to sign a document saying that they are willing for you to stand. If this is something which you are potentially interested in, then please contact the Nominations team (\n [nominations@pirateparty.org.uk](mailto:nominations@pirateparty.org.uk) \n ) letting us know where you live. (and/or work) (so we can identify your local authority and hence highlight any potential by-elections)\n \n\n\n\n Additionally, below the Local Authority level, there are 'Parish Councils' in some places (particularly the more rural areas of the country) - typically there are less people willing to stand for these roles than places available, so you can often get 'elected' straight away. Again, if this is something that you are potentially interested in, then look around in your area, or contact the Nominations Team as above.\n \n\n\n\n**Pirates in your area** \n\n\n\n\n Equally, there are other ways to get involved locally - we already have local branches in some areas which are great opportunities to meet likeminded people and discuss how we can be spreading the Pirate message in your area. The following is a list of contact details and Community pages that you may want to follow, friend, and get involved in.

'when is the next event?'\n \n\n\n\n The free use of language is core to the ethos of our party.\u00a0 One of the other wonderful things about the event at Regent's Park is that is gave us an opportunity to properly talk with people who are not already party members, but who were interested to find out more.\u00a0 A lot of people prefer to engage in a personal conversation, rather than receive one-way communication or present themselves as a 'newbie' over the internet.\u00a0 Passerbys sat in on Andrew's talk, took leaflets and, most importantly, took away a positive impression about our values and what we stand for.\u00a0 Some of those people may never have found us on the internet, but they may well speak positively about us to their friends, or be more inclined to listen if one of our candidates is talking on the radio.\u00a0 One of the other speakers at the Regent's Park event was\n [Professor Gary Hall of Coventry University](http://www.garyhall.info/) \n .\u00a0 I hope we made a new friend in Gary.\u00a0 Gary is an academic who not only wrote an article called 'Pirate Philosophy' about the impact of 'piracy' on academia, media and culture, but who also distributed the article using P2P and encourages people to rewrite the P2P version as they please.\u00a0 Even though Gary may well have heard of us through the internet or mainstream media, and clearly knows how to use technology to connect with people remotely, it still makes a difference to actually see the supporters in person, and to engage them in dialogue, as Gary did.\u00a0 I believe we also made friends with the organizers of the Treehouse Gallery at Regent's Park, who invited us along.\u00a0 We owe them thanks for the invite, and I hope that after seeing the numbers of people who came along from the Pirate Party, that they are encouraged to get involved too.\n \n\n\n\n To answer that question, 'when is the next event?', I first must first ask a question: 'who wants to organize it?'\u00a0 In other words, members should feel free to take the initiative and propose and arrange meet-ups and events using the party's wiki and forums.\u00a0 We can use new technology to assist with the old-fashioned challenge of getting to know our fellow party members and making contact with the general public.\u00a0 We are all interested in politics because we want to take the fight to our enemies in big business and big government.\u00a0 To do that, the first thing we must do is make lots of friends.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["friends"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/making-friends", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160619120917/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/making-friends", "date": "2009-09-06T00:00:00+01:00"}, "/blog/editor/french-pirates-get-206-election": {"state": "full", "title": "French Pirates get 2.06% in by-election", "body": "\n\n\n\n France's\n [*Parti Pirate*](http://partipirate.org/blog/index.php)\n fought its first election on Sunday.

Not even the wildest pirate having the most insane pirate dream would make this up.\n \n\n\n\n**Lily Allen, through her website LilyAllenMusic.com, infringes copyright by offering the music of other artists for free download.** \n\n\n\n\n You can read the full story at\n [Michael Masnick's Techdirt blog](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090923/1409046297.shtml) \n .\n \n\n\n\n Lily Allen has publicly argued that infringing copyright is wrong because it is the same as stealing. She said downloading pirated music is killing the music industry. Except, it seems, when it helps her music career.\n \n\n\n\n\n Allen also said she agrees with the government's intended crackdown on piracy because the targets for punishment will be those who upload, not those who download - going after the metaphorical 'pushers' of pirated music, as opposed to the 'users'.\n \n\n\n\n You heard Ms. Allen!\u00a0 Go download your free copyright-infringing music:\n [mixtape1](http://www.lilyallenmusic.com/music/demos/5geuj0iedc/MyFirstMixtape.mp3) \n and\n [mixtape2](http://www.lilyallenmusic.com/music/demos/csd23dsms7/LilyAllenMixTape2.mp3) \n .\n *(Update: they have now ripped down the files from the web - but read on below...)* \n Lily wants you to share and enjoy her choice of other people's music. The compilation is an eclectic mix of Lily interspersed with other artists. I even recognized a burst of \"Joe Le Taxi\" in there. Best of all, Lily does not think you should be punished. She thinks the person who uploaded should be punished, which in this case would be Lily Allen.\n \n\n\n\n Better download your evidence of Allen's hypocrisy fast. It will not be long before the well-paid but sleepy execs finally wake up to what Allen has done. When they do, they will go into full-on PR damage-limitation mode, starting by ripping down the offending 'mixtapes'. It looks like she has already begun the retreat.\n [Allen's pro-copyright blog has disappeared](http://idontwanttochangetheworld.blogspot.com/) \n , presumably to stem the tide of comments from ordinary folks gloating at the revelation that Allen is a copyright hypocrite. But before the blog disappeared, the Daily Mail reports that\n [she blogged she would never release another track](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1215725/Lily-Allen-declares-quitting-music-career-acting.html) \n . I am not Perez Hilton, so I cannot speculate whether this is a Britney Spears-like emotional cry for help from a confused young woman, or a cynical exercise to limit the harm Allen has done to her own career. What we can say is that some in the mainstream music industry are happy to use celebrities to push a\n *political* \n agenda in order to promote their business interests. But Allen's actions show that real people, and even music celebrities, do not and cannot abide by the copyright laws that the dysfunctional half of the music industry wants to force upon us. We need reform of the law, not harsher enforcement, and this sorry fiasco proves it.\n \n\n\n\n Moral of the story: the copyright laws are broken, and need fixing. Even outspoken critics of downloading find themselves breaking copyright laws and they see nothing wrong with doing it. The government intends to criminalize millions in a vain attempt to change human nature. This is absurd. If even Lily Allen does not respect copyright law in practice then the government is making a mistake by trying to bully millions into obeying it.\n \n\n\n\n The other moral of the story: do not try to take the high ground in a debate about copyright reform with Michael Masnick! This all started when Allen violated Masnick's copyright whilst trying to project herself as a spokesperson for the the moral necessity of copyright laws. Good laws do not result from an over-simplistic analogy like 'copying is stealing'. Laws should also reflect human nature, and human sensibilities about right and wrong. Masnick makes sophisticated arguments for improving worldwide copyright law, whilst Allen responded with platitudes. Yet people like Allen see nothing wrong with copying when it suits them. That means we should change the laws, not try to change millions of decent people who already know the difference between right and wrong. It is not the majority of ordinary people who cannot tell right from wrong, although sometimes people like Lily Allen can get themselves mixed up. It is the law that cannot tell right from wrong, which is why it must be changed.\n \n\n\n\n Allen's actions, for all her privileged access to media, speak far more loudly than her words. In a way she never imagined possible, Lily Allen has become the best argument for fixing our broken copyright laws.\n \n\n\n\n ***\n \n\n\n\n Update: As expected, Lily Allen's media handlers went into overdrive to try to fix her reputation by using spin and other tactics to distract attention from the real story. This includes tearing down the pirated music from LilyAllenMusic.com in the hope of burying the evidence. Allen's cronies are trying to hide the truth of what Lily Allen did - she broke the law. She infringed the copyright of other musicians, even though she argues that people should be punished for doing much the same. I cannot stand by and be idle whilst they attempt to get away with it.\n *PPUK does not condone breaking the law, and I want to make it clear that what I am about to do is done in a personal capacity, on my website which is not owned or controlled by PPUK. What I am about to do has not been authorized by, approved by, or discussed with anyone else in PPUK, and I alone am responsible.* \n I am now going to break the law too, in the hope that people will find the evidence of Lily's behaviour and judge her by her actions, not by her (spin doctor's) words. If you want the proof of Lily Allen's copyright infringement, I downloaded the files from LilyAllenMusic.com earlier today, and have now put Lily Allen's\n [mixtape1](http://halfthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/MyFirstMixtape.mp3) \n and\n [mixtape2](http://halfthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/LilyAllenMixTape2.mp3) \n on my own website.\n \n\n\n\n Let them come and sue me if they want. I would rather pay the price exacted by an unjust legal system than stand idle while these hypocrites attempt to get away with their double-dealing. People deserve to know the truth, not the carefully-crafted deceit of these professional dissemblers. These people would happily use and abuse the law to control who can say what, who can do what. They say what they like, we must listen. They want to airbrush the truth and rewrite it to suit themselves, they ask us to look away whilst they get to work. Allen's mix is a bad cocktail of Orwellian nightmares and corporate greed, with one rule for the elite, another for the rest of us. We cannot allow our freedoms to be manipulated and undermined. If that means I will be punished, so be it.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["Copyright", "Lily Allen"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/illegal-downloads-lilyallenmusiccom", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160619113102/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/illegal-downloads-lilyallenmusiccom", "date": "2009-09-24T00:00:00+01:00"}, "/blog/editor/trafigura-battle-won-war-still-fight": {"state": "full", "title": "Trafigura - a battle won, but a war still to fight.", "body": "\n\n\n\n Two days ago, very few people had heard of Trafigura.

Every one of us lives under with an incredible level of scrutiny and snooping every day. Our communications are collected, our movements tracked and our actions watched by the state and others. But there has been little discussion about whether this surveillance is appropriate or necessary. We know it isn't.\n \n\n\n\n There has been far too little real political opposition to ever increasing monitoring. Even while the Liberal Democrat / Conservative Coalition\n [claimed it would reduce the 'database state'](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78977/coalition_programme_for_government.pdf) \n it continued to push for more monitoring and data collection.

When we talk about surveillance today, it is we have to remember that the only reason we know about the full extent of the snooping we live under is because\n [whistleblowers were brave enough to make that secret information public.](/blog/andy-halsall/opinion-prism-suspicious-until-proven-innocent) \n\n\n\n\n Our governments\n [haven't been open with us](/dont-spy-us-its-time-hold-politicians-account-mass-surveillance) \n about the broad focus of their surveillance or its scope and the machinery of surveillance is much bigger than we thought it was.

That makes the UK the world leader in video monitoring. We are monitored in our city centres, whilst shopping, at transport hubs and whilst on trains and busses. It is almost impossible not to be captured on film on a daily basis. \u00a0The worst part is that CCTV doesn't help to prevent crime, at best it moves it around..\n \n\n\n### \n Tracking Movements\n\n\n\n ANPR cameras are used to monitor traffic movements and information is collected regardless of suspicion. Initially ANPR was introduced as a tool to spot stolen cars, but has since become a tool of mass surveillance. Since 2000 a nationwide network of roadside cameras connected to ANPR systems has\n [tracked, recorded, and stored](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police-enforced_ANPR_in_the_UK) \n the details of all journeys undertaken on major roads and through city centres. Movement data is stored for five years.\n \n\n\n\n Public transport ticketing systems, like London's Oyster can and are used to track specific peoples movements. Over 22,000 requests have been made by the Metropolitan Police for information on people's movements and anonymous options for travel on public transport are becoming less and less available.\n \n\n\n### \n DNA & Biometrics\n\n\n\n The British Police hold records of millions fingerprints and DNA samples on the National DNA Database. There is increasing use of roadside fingerprinting, an approach that may provide an additional incentive for the Police to make speculative arrests so that more fingerprints are held on the Database. It's not just the state using biometrics, concerns have also been raised over the unregulated use of\n [biometrics in schools](http://www.tes.co.uk/teaching-resource/The-issue-Biometric-identification-6054225/) \n , affecting children as young as three.\n \n\n\n### \n Our\u00a0Communications\n\n\n\n In addition to the existing collection of phone records, plans were being made in 2008 to collect data on all phone calls, e-mails, chat room discussions and web-browsing habits as part of the\u00a0Labour Government's Interception Modernisation Programme (and then the Coalition's '\n [Snoopers Charter](/uk-snoopers-charter-raises-its-ugly-head-again) \n ').

Negotiations started in July 2013 and still continue although it could be signed and sealed as early as the end of 2014. If signed it will have a massive impact on every man, woman and child in the UK, yet the details of it are being negotiated in secret and we aren't being properly consulted on what is being given away.\n \n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625092709im_/http://pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/campaigns_material/previews/TTIP.png?itok=8sn1xzFa)\n\n\n\n\n It's the secrecy around TTIP that is really worrying. When coupled with a number of leaks that seem to suggest that the treaty will grant corporations and business interests benefits at the expense of consumers and citizens TTIP presents a real danger to society.\n \n\n\n\n Recent reports suggest that the deal will end up focusing on non-conventional 'trade barriers' like cutting the regulations around fracking, Genetic Modification and finance whilst tightening laws that harm innovation and culture like copyright. The agreement could also bring worrying legal processes like '\n [Investor State Dispute Settlement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor_State_Dispute_Settlement) \n ' (ISDS) making it harder for governments to protect the interests of their citizens and legislate to protect the environment and workers. What is more it seems that alongside the harm, the benefits will be much lower than suggested.\n \n\n\n## \n What you need to know.\n\n\n### \n Secrecy\n\n\n\n Apart from a few leaks and weak assurances from those involved in the negotiations, TTIP has been negotiated behind closed doors. The largest agreement of its kind ever attempted, and we has seen little public scrutiny and consultation. This means we will be told, the agreement brings massive benefits, but without the time to weigh up the negatives. We must be listened to now!\n \n\n\n### \n Big Business\n\n\n\n[ISDS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor_State_Dispute_Settlement) \n means that investors can take legal action against the country hosting its investment, without the intervention of the government of the investor\u2019s home country. In short, corporations can sue national governments if any of the corporations future profit making possibilities are affected by new laws or protections. As a result new environmental and employment protections could come with a cost, payed directly to big business.\n \n\n\n\n Similar agreements have already seen large corporates sue and win when governments have banned toxic additives, all on the basis that the maker of the toxic additive would lose money under the ban...\n \n\n\n### \n Our NHS\n\n\n\n Three principles have guided the\n [NHS since its beginning](http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/nhscoreprinciples.aspx) \n : That the NHS would meet the needs of everyone, that it be free at the point of delivery and that it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay.\n \n\n\n\n These principles have already been weakened by\n [The Health and Social Care Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/7/contents/enacted) \n and would be eroded further under TTIP. The introduction of artificial competition in the NHS, with public providers deliberately placed at a disadvantage is fragmenting the NHS and opening it up to competition law. It is turning healthcare into a market in which private companies can run rampant. In short the NHS can now seen as a commercial operation and that means it will be subject to free trade agreements like TTIP.\n \n\n\n\n The US/EU trade deal will mean that the NHS will have to consider the rights of transnational organisations rather than focus on the care of patients. It would open the NHS up to large transnational health businesses and place severe restrictions on the ability of the UK government to control costs of medicine and care. Worst of all, it would limit the ability of our Governments to regulate the transnational companies that will step in to take control of our NHS.\n \n\n\n### \n Public Health\n\n\n\n It's not just the NHS that could be harmed by TTIP. The impact of ISDS will create a chilling effect on governments, making them far more likely to hold back on introducing new public health regulations for fear that they might negatively affect international companies' future investment or profit opportunities.\n \n\n\n### \n Food standards\n\n\n\n Food standards are one area where the US claims that there are too many barriers for its producers in the EU. TTIP is intended to remove such barriers, but rather than raising standards it would likely be used to lower them. The deal would mean that foods that are fine for human consumption in thee US but are banned in the UK or EU could end up on our supermarket shelves. That could include:\n \n\n\n* [Chlorine washed chicken](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1022821/Dirty-US-chicken-washed-chlorine-heading-British-shops-E-C-seeks-improve-relations-America.html)\n* [Beef and pork treated with growth hormones](http://www.preventcancer.com/consumers/general/hormones_meat.htm)\n* Increased use of\n [genetically modified material](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food) \n in our food\n\n\n\n It may even lead to a reduction in labelling requirements to meet lower US standards, meaning that food sourced and processed in ways currently not permitted in the EU would not even be labelled as such..\n \n\n\n### \n Internet Freedom\n\n\n\n It is likely that TTIP will address copyright and patents and that the approach will be similar to the approaches the US has taken with other agreements, including TPP and\n [ACTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTA) \n . That would make TTIP very dangerous to those who value a free and open internet. There will be attempts to provide corporations with even more excessive copyright term limits, remove protections that promote interoperability and other elements that are anti-user but corporation-friendly. It is also possible that TTIP will again attempt to force Internet Service Providers to take on a role in law enforcement.\n \n\n\n### \n Data Protection\n\n\n\n Given the pro-business aspects of aspects like ISDS the treaty could also do signficant damage to the EU's data protection and privacy principles, subverting them where they harm the profit of large corporates.\n \n\n\n### \n Climate Change\n\n\n\n TTIP could also tie legislators hands in dealing with climate change as incentives and regulations intended to reduce emissions and pollution are weakened. One of the most effective ways of reducing environmental harm of this sort is to stress the importance of locally sourced food, goods and energy and regulate where appropriate. Of course that would be seen as an unfair barrier and again lead to legal action by those whose bottom lines might be harmed.\n \n\n\n\n A vast, secret, unaccountable free trade deal that aims to accelerate globalisation and limit regulation, whilst trumping national governments must be a great concern to anyone looking for solutions to the climate crisis. A specific issue would be the agreements impact on UK and EU climate legislation, especially as it relates to Canadian and US plans to export tar sands oil to Europe.\n \n\n\n## \n What we need to do\n\n\n* Demand more openness when trade agreements are negotiated\n* Require comprehensive access to information and public hearings\n* Ensure that respect for self determination and privacy are included\n* Require that the interests of citizens and small and medium-sized enterprises are be taken into account\n* Stop TTIP in its current form\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": [], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/campaigns/issues/ttip-trading-away-our-rights", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140626163045/http://pirateparty.org.uk/campaigns/issues/ttip-trading-away-our-rights"}, "/press/vodafone-reveals-secret-wires-allowing-direct-access-government-spying": {"state": "full", "title": "Vodafone reveals secret wires allowing direct-access government spying", "body": "\n\n\n\n Vodafone has revealed direct connections to its network (and those of other telecoms groups) that allow government agencies to access, listen to, and record all conversations on its networks and, in some cases, track customers.\n \n\n\n\n The scope of this access covers not just the UK, but also some of the 29 countries in which Vodafone operates in Europe and beyond.

And of course I wish they could too. However what all of these people want is not just a name on a ballot. They expect us to field strong candidates, like the ones we have now. They expect us to work hard for our ideas, and to campaign. I'm happy (and somewhat exhausted!) to say that's what we have been doing.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The North West European Parliament election is also the first national election we have fought on the platform we crowd sourced in 2012. Yes, we have had local votes and by-elections since then, but these have only allowed a public in very particular areas the opportunity to get to know us better. It's made a huge difference to the European Parliament campaign, as most of the incoming questions I have been fielding are nothing to do with digital rights, it has been about a European referendum, nuclear power, fracking, democratic reform, the rights of young people.\n \n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20140626163314im_/http://pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/PeoplePower.png?itok=giexnjFY)\n What we find is that when a wider public gets to know us, they like what they see. Well, that's pretty much most of the time. We're also honest about our positions- so we aren't afraid to disappoint the few who simply disagree with us on key points of policy. But the people who are getting to know us, are starting to want to vote for us too.\n \n\n\n\n It's a hard job persuading people. I've been doing that to the best of my ability over the last few weeks, and will continue to do that over the next days. We all have a role to play in this.

It only takes a few minutes to help others to get to know us.\n \n\n\n\n I love elections- which is probably just as well really. They're exciting, infuriating, challenging. But it is what we do.

After a 9-year break working in Germany at Universities, Research Institutes and start-ups, I came back in 2005 to work for a big American IT company here in Manchester. Since 2008, I've been running successfully my own IT Consultancy, DialogCONNECTION Ltd., based in the Manchester City Centre and serving clients all over the world (US, Asia, and Europe, including the European Commission in the past 6 months). So,\n **having lived and worked here for a total of 14 years, Manchester is my chosen home!** \n\n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625053536im_/http://pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/Bloody%20Legislation_0.PNG?itok=VKamtwY6)\n\n\n\n\n In that time, apart from being active in the professional world of IT Business, I have channelled my love for electronic music by supporting the associated music scene of the North West and becoming a (Drum'n'Bass and Dubstep) DJ, podcaster, and promoter myself, playing and organising gigs all over England, broadcasting online radio shows and supporting young producers in making a name for themselves.\n \n\n\n\n Having always been interested in local, European, and World affairs (since my teens), I have always been aware of the big issues, the fine interdependencies, and the common illusions. On the local level, I have always just tried to improve things around me, even if it just meant filling in a feedback form, or taking the time to email the Council or a service provider about a failing.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n At the same time,\n **I have been online since 1991** \n , when most people were not (the advantage of being an Academic in the UK at the time), and I was enthusiastic about the advent of email, chat, forums, and cloud-based services, which I started using profusely early on. The internet gave me my Post-Doc position in Germany (I found the ad in an online newsgroup and applied and got interviewed online), funded by\n **the EU's \"Human Capital Mobility\" programme** \n , which encourages EU citizens to go and live and work in another EU country which they had perhaps never intended to go and live in or even visit before, or whose language they don't even speak a word of (My German vocabulary when I arrived in Germany consisted of just 60 words). So I was actually\n **sponsored to emigrate from the UK to Germany!** \n The internet gave me my first job in industry in Berlin (My later boss found my University profile online). The internet got me a job back in Manchester (yet another Newsgroup), and it's through the internet that I get all my client work for my company (Tip: LinkedIn is your friend!).\n \n\n\n\n Needless to say, the internet has also educated me (I am\n **an avid Coursera serial student** \n , having taken and completed more than 10 online courses from EU Law, English Common Law and International Criminal Law to US Foreign Policy, Digital Democracy, Networks, Philosophy, and Astrobiology). And of course, like the case is with most people, the internet also helped me find and connect with people all over the planet who share something with me (from a biographical detail to a personal and professional interest). It has helped me meet wonderful people in real life, even though it started mostly anonymously, virtually and on the ether.\n \n\n\n\n**When in the last few years, things started taking a nasty turn** \n , with requests to block access to websites coming not just from the Government but also from Charities and NGOs, and at the same time we suddenly relinquished complete transparency of our own private lives and personal data with the advent of the geolocated, tagged, and personalised smartphones and apps, such as Facebook and Foursquare,\n **I became really worried** \n . It seemed to me that suddenly\n **a modern version of the Dark Ages was dawning** \n : blocking websites on the basis of keywords mentioned on them is to me dangerously similar to the book burning of scientific books by the Church in the Middle Ages. Blindly censoring webpages on the basis of keywords, whose choice is questionable in itself, can literally block half of the internet, with the catastrophic consequences that this can bring (lack of information, education, and emotional support). When at the same time,\n **normal citizens are supposed to freely give out data on themselves and their private lives** \n (for better targeted personalised ad campaigns),\n **not complain when this data is passed on to third parties without any consent or other legal or moral control** \n (in the name of research they say, but mainly in the name of business plans and profit), and\n **even having the original collector of the data benefit financially in some cases** \n from the fact, is grossly unfair and completely contradictory.\n \n\n\n\n**It was concerns such as these that motivated me to join the UK Pirate Party** \n back in 2012 and to even stand in the local elections that year in the Manchester City Centre Ward. As a new Party, this campaign was rather a success, given that I personally got 3.1% of the (admittedly very few) votes (just 13.65% of the people in the City Centre came out to vote) and the Party Leader,\n [Loz Kaye](/loz-kaye) \n , 5.2% even,\n **both of us beating Parties, such as UKIP and the LibDems** \n . The local elections gave me the chance to talk to people I wouldn't normally have the chance to talk to. And I already know people from all kinds of social and professional backgrounds. It also showed me how\n **the Pirate Party is different to anything that has ever been around in Politics, as the motivation is the Common Good and not \"Our Good\". We are concerned citizens and professionals** \n (Academics, Entrepreneurs, Social Workers, Musicians) who are sufficiently up-to-date with modern technology to know its benefits, its shortcomings and the threats towards it, sufficiently aware of the current political demagogy surrounding technology and the internet, and\n \n**worried about having our personal and citizen's rights surreptitiously stripped by not allowing transparency in Government, Business, or the Internet, and yet demanding and exploiting our transparency provided by the same technologies that they damn** \n\n .\n \n\n\n\n This year's European Parliamentary Elections were the natural next step for me. Even as a 15-year-old in Greece I was excited about the concept of the \"United States of Europe\" (with the emphasis on \"United\" rather than on \"States\"), that Greece had joined 3 years before.\n **I was thrilled by the idea of being able to live and work wherever you wanted, following similar laws and regulations, and not having to have a particular nationality to do certain things** \n . In fact, my entry (on a postcard!) to a then European Community competition on \"What the European Community means to you\" later won me a free trip to Portugal! I was the lucky recipient of a European Union Human Capital Mobility Post-Doctoral Fellowship when I moved to Germany in 1996 from the UK, and in 2013 my company was the lucky recipient of European Commission funding as part of a large 3-year Research & Development project with partners from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and Greece. And I have just been engaged by the EC as an external Expert on Research proposal evaluation.\n \n\n\n\n It has all come round.\n **Born and raised in Greece, having attended Universities in Greece, the UK, and Germany, and having worked and paid taxes in all 3 countries** \n , I think I am the quintessential European;\n **that's what the EU Founders had in mind when they were coming up with the vision** \n . \u00a0Or that's what I like to think.\n \n\n\n\n The funny thing with having lived in 3 countries is that you learn to love and defend all three, even when you see the failings and negatives in each one of them. Things become less black-and-white and you start seeing things from many different perspectives, because even just speaking a language fluently lets you in the mindset and the psyche of that nation. As a result, you can actually \"communicate\" with them; a very underrated skill nowadays, when the focus is more on marketing, promotion, PR, and appearances. And\n **I'm lucky to be fluent in 4 EU languages** \n , English, German, French, and my mother tongue, Greek.\n \n\n\n\n I want to get elected as an MEP, because I can contribute to the European Parliament the unique perspective of someone with practically 3 national identities (or dare I say, a single \"merged\" European identity), with experience in both the idealistic, detail-oriented world of Academia and the fast-moving and relentless world of Business; with technical expertise that makes me understand what the issues are and how to address them; with a good understanding of the English, European, and International Laws and issues, and with communication skills and interests that help me relate equally to a 15-year-old skater, a 45-year-old CEO, and an 85-year-old pensioner.\n \n\n\n\n Undoubtedly,\n **there is a lot that urgently needs to change with the EU** \n . The European Parliament, as the direct voice of all EU citizens, should be given more powers in introducing but also vetoing laws and regulations. Negotiations and lobbying should never take place behind closed doors, and decision-making should be made more transparent, democratic, and evidence-based. Each EU country should have more flexibility in the timeframe available to implement EU-wide regulations. The EU gives guidance centrally, but the UK implements locally and taking the local context into account. For example, when I was working for a UK company a few years ago, I was \"encouraged\" to sign the EU Opt-out clause doing away with my right to claim overtime. The motivation was apparently less red tape and admin in keeping detailed timesheets and another reason given to me was that \"Everybody else here has already signed the Opt-out form\". (Yes, it is possible, despite the EU Directive on the matter). And given that many people in the UK want the freedom and their democratic right to hold a referendum on the UK's membership in the EU, the UK Pirate Party and myself\n **fully support a referendum on the EU** \n .\n \n\n\n\n However, just abandoning the EU is no solution for the UK. In fact,\n **if the UK left the EU, that would be catastrophic for the UK Industry, Economy, and Diplomacy and the UK's position as a World Power** \n . The EU is not just prescribing which type of cheese should be allowed the name \"feta cheese\"; it also does away with long and complicated export procedures and forms and having to pay export duties each time a product or service enters a different EU country. The associated cost for UK Businesses would be prohibitive and would considerably shrink UK exports. But unfortunately, the current political rhetoric on the subject of EU membership focuses on \"immigration\" and \"foreigners coming here and stealing our jobs\".\n **Nobody is talking about all the \"foreigners\" who come here and pay taxes which fund UK schools and UK hospitals, nor of the \"foreigners\" who set up businesses here and give Brits jobs (as well as contribute to the growth of the UK Economy).** \n And of course nobody is talking about all the Brits who emigrate and thrive in other EU countries. Even less do we speak of all the\n \n**\"Bloody EU Regulations, coming to this country and giving us rights!\"** \n\n to adapt the Tweet shown here. We all need to rethink our relationship with the EU, as well as demand its democratic reform.\n **What we need is Family therapy. It would be wrong to go straight for Divorce** \n .\n \n\n\n\n The first step is of course to go out and vote in the European Parliamentary Elections! And vote for candidates who stand for democracy and civil and human rights. The fewer people go out and vote, the less representative of our will, beliefs, and needs the appointed MEPs are going to be.\n **This is what brings fascists into power: apathy and scapegoats.** \n\n\n\n\n You can contact me by email at\n [m.aretoulaki@pirateparty.org.uk](/blog/editor/m.aretoulaki@pirateparty.org.uk) \n or add a comment to this post.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["EU", "European Union", "European Parliament", "#EP2014", "Euroelections", "European Parliamentary Elections", "Maria Aretoulaki", "MEP Candidate", "Pirate Party UK"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/party-magazine/bloody-eu-regulations-coming-here-and-giving-us-rights", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140625074756/http://pirateparty.org.uk/party-magazine/bloody-eu-regulations-coming-here-and-giving-us-rights"}, "/blogs/ed-geraghty/seeking-ruby-developers": {"state": "full", "title": "Seeking Ruby Developers!", "body": "\n\n\n\n We may have a new website, but that is just the start of our plans to open up politics.\u00a0 In association with\n [Lancaster University](http://lancaster.ac.uk/) \n , we want to take the lessons we learnt in our \"Policy Alpha\" project which ran on\n [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Policy2011/) \n ,\n [twitter](http://twitter.com/PiratePartyUK) \n and elsewhere, and formed our\n [manifesto in 2012](https://pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/Manifesto2012.pdf) \n , and take it to the next step: Policy Beta.\n \n\n\n## \n\n\n## \n About Policy Beta\n\n\n\n Policy Beta is our next big IT project.\u00a0 We want to create a digital platform for citizens to network, generate ideas, debate issues, and vote on the policies that we will adopt.\u00a0 It's going to be our way of deciding the Party's direction and with that, the pressure we put on government.\u00a0 Policy Beta will do what we did\n [manually in Policy Alpha back in 2011/12](https://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/ajehals/policy-2012-next-steps) \n and much more.

Some, such as Nottingham City Council, are also redirecting users trying to visit those sites to the website of the local\n [credit union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union) \n . Usually this web blocking is part of a wider anti-debt strategy designed to help local people manage their money better that might include debt advice and personal finance courses.\n \n\n\n\n This is a fundamental shift in how public libraries think about providing internet access. Public libraries have always blocked some websites. They block illegal material such as child abuse images and political extremism. And they block legal pornography because viewing it could be disruptive and offensive to some patrons beyond the person who\u2019s choosing to view it. But blocking the websites of legal businesses because the council disagrees with some of their commercial practices takes us into the realm of paternalism: restricting access to information for the individual\u2019s supposed own good.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You don\u2019t need to be an uncritical champion of the financial services industry to see why this is a bad idea. Payday loan companies are generally predatory bastards but that doesn\u2019t make them unique, either within financial services or within business more generally. The list of websites that could be considered harmful to individuals in one way or another is very long indeed. Go any further down this road and not only would libraries need to devote increasing resources to identifying and blocking many more things that could be harmful to individuals but they\u2019d also start to be seen as having a responsibility to do so. People would begin to ask \u2013 with some justification \u2013 why the council didn\u2019t stop them taking out an expensive loan, buying a worthless product or joining a cult using a library computer.\n \n\n\n\n We shouldn\u2019t assume that blocking payday loan websites will make much difference to the number of loans people take. It may even make the problem worse. Someone researching payday loans online will find plenty of criticism and advice about them. The first result for\n [\u201cpayday loans\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payday_loan) \n in the most popular search engine is a Wikipedia article which devotes plenty of space to criticism and alternatives. But even if someone\u2019s decided that they\u2019d like a payday loan, researching online will at least give them the chance to shop around for a loan on the best terms, in their own time, and in a low-pressure environment. What happens if you block this kind of research task? People wanting payday loans will go straight to the high street and most likely take out a loan in the first shop they come to that offers them. They\u2019ll be subject to high-pressure sales methods in the store and will probably get a worse deal than they would if they\u2019d shopped around online.\n \n\n\n\n This kind of web blocking causes collateral damage too. I would have found it almost impossible to write this article on an internet connection that blocked payday loan websites. Web blocking doesn\u2019t just prevent people researching payday loans with a view to getting one, it blocks people researching the subject for any reason. Students, journalists, activists, debt advisors, politicians and even concerned friends and family members would all find their public library entirely useless for their innocuous and arguably beneficial work.\n \n\n\n\n If the public library becomes less useful for a particular task then its reputation suffers. People will start to avoid it and go elsewhere if they can. And ultimately, web blocking damages the reputation of the internet itself. Imagine how you\u2019d feel about the internet if much of the time you went online you were blocked from seeing things that you knew were there, just not there for you. The internet succeeds when it rewards people with the information they seek, not when it tells them they\u2019re not entitled to it.\n \n\n\n\n Every act of censorship in public libraries opens up a new\n [digital divide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide) \n . Traditionally we think of digital inclusion in terms of who\u2019s online and who isn\u2019t. But blocking websites on public computers and networks puts the users who depend on them into a lower class of online citizens: those who get less of the web than the rest of us. We can reasonably assume that the councillors and managers who devise these censorship schemes wouldn\u2019t tolerate them for one second on their personal computers. Yet they\u2019re quite happy to assume the role of judge, jury and executioner for the information access rights of those they purport to serve.\n \n\n\n\n Not only must this kind of censorship stop, but the information access policies of these councils must be reversed. Any organisation claiming to be working to increase digital inclusion must actively oppose censorship on its own systems and elsewhere, not just refrain from it themselves. Otherwise, we\u2019ll be getting more and more people online only for them to find that there\u2019s less and less for them when they get there. We want people who are marginalised to learn that the internet is a place of freedom, not one bound with the same kind of petty restrictions and privations they face elsewhere. Most of all, we\u2019d like everyone to learn by experience that equality is possible online today, even if it\u2019s harder to achieve everywhere else.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What do you think:\n [Should public libraries block payday loan websites?](http://pirateparty.org.uk/poll/should-public-libraries-block-payday-loan-websites) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["Libraries", "Censorship", "Internet"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/adrian-short/should-public-libraries-block-payday-loan-websites", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140625113116/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/adrian-short/should-public-libraries-block-payday-loan-websites", "date": "2014-04-03T18:09:44+01:00"}, "/blog/editor/new-website-here": {"state": "full", "title": "The new website is here!", "body": "\n\n\n\n As you can see the website is all nice, new and shiny!

The answer, quite simply is no.\n \n\n\n\n The inescapable conclusion is that the government are not intending to fund the expensive luxury of justice for those accused of file sharing. We can only afford to have a system without justice, where simply being denounced by a copyright-holder is sufficient for summary punishment to be dealt out, and that summary punishment will be dealt out to 70% of 7 million people.\n \n\n\n\n If you believe that denying a fair trial to around 5 million people in this country is wrong, maybe it's time to join the Pirate Party?\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["File sharing", "Copyright"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/price-justice", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140701192911/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/price-justice", "date": "2009-08-21T00:00:00+01:00"}, "/blog/editor/pirate-party-surpasses-labour-party-facebook": {"state": "full", "title": "Pirate Party surpasses Labour Party on Facebook", "body": "\n\n\n\n It appears the Pirate Party is more popular than the Labour Party, at least on Facebook.\n [Our group there](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=102577189324) \n -- at the time of writing -- has 6364 supporters, whereas\n [Labour's](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2204504933) \n has only 6356.

Thursday saw the final barrier to France's\n *three strikes* \n law removed as the Constitutional Court\n [ruled that it was legal](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/10/french-3-strikes-law-returns-now-with-judicial-oversight.ars) \n . This is the first such law to be passed specifically to target illegal file-sharers and is unlikely to be the last. This action was supported by the recent progress made in Brussels with the notorious\n [Telecoms Reform Package](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecoms_Package) \n , legislation that will decide what restrictions can be placed on disconnected Internet users.\n \n\n\n\n\n The Telecoms Package was first proposed over two years ago and at its first reading (September 2008), the European Parliament amended the legislation to ensure that...\n \n\n\n\n> \n> \n>  \"no restriction [could] be imposed on ... end-users without a prior ruling of the judicial authorities ... except when public security is threatened, in which case the ruling may be subsequent.\" (\n>  [Amendment; (8) d) ii) h](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&language=EN&reference=P6-TA-2008-0449) \n>  )\n>  \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\n Despite the French president directly intervening by\n [Amendment 46](http://www.ecrans.fr/Exclusif-La-lettre-de-Sarkozy-a,5340.html%3Esending%20a%20letter%3C/a%3E%20to%20the%20head%20of%20the%20European%20Commission%20asking%20that%20this%20be%20removed,%20the%20Committee%20on%20Industry,%20Research%20and%20Energy%20%28ITRE%29%20voted%2040%20to%204%20to%20keep%20it%20as%20%3Ca%20href=) \n (previously Amendment 138). This was then put before the European Parliament which\n [supported this overwhelmingly](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/07/technology/07iht-telecoms.html) \n (by 88%) in May 2009. As a result of this impasse between the Parliament (elected by people from all member states) and the European Council of Ministers (an appointed senior representative from each state), a Conciliation Committee was set up to negotiate a compromise. During this process, the French authorities broke protocol by\n [directly contacting](http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lemonde.fr%2Ftechnologies%2Farticle%2F2009%2F09%2F29%2Fhadopi-une-deputee-suedoise-accuse-la-france-d-avoir-tente-de-l-influencer_1246566_651865.html) \n a Swedish MP who was told her support of Amendment 46 was \"problematic\" (the French Embassy in Stockholm admitted meeting with her but denied trying to influence her opinion and so interfere with Swedish procedures).\n \n\n\n\n The Council presented a proposed alteration to the Amendment, but this was widely\n [regarded as unacceptable](http://www.laquadrature.net/en/telecoms-package-does-the-council-of-eu-hate-freedom) \n as it removed the requirement of judicial rulings in cases involving \"the prevention, investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offences\", once again ignoring the opinions of over 400 MEPs. Then, when the negotiators met with the Council they\n [only discussed this proposal](http://christianengstrom.wordpress.com/2009/10/23/2440/) \n , not the original Amendment 46, ignoring the mandate given to them by the delegation. Christian Engstr\u00f6m (MEP for the Swedish Pirate Party and a member of the delegation) openly criticised the chairman of the delegation for this. The French \"rapporteur\", Catherine Trautmann also\n [came under fire](http://www.laquadrature.net/en/amendment-138-why-does-trautmann-persevere-in-giving-up) \n for consciously abandoning Parliament's proposal. Engstr\u00f6m and his colleagues nevertheless worked with the delegation in an attempt to undo the damage, submitting a new proposal for the negotiators which, while not as strong as the original Amendment 138, still required that any sanctions be taken only in \"extreme circumstances\" and by a \"\n **prior** \n , fair and impartial procedure\". It also removed the specific cases mentioned above involving criminal offences.\n \n\n\n\n However, in what was described this week as an\n [\"insult to the parliament\"](http://christianengstrom.wordpress.com/2009/10/23/an-insult-to-the-parliament/) \n , the Ministers ignored the delegation and\n [removed from the proposal](http://christianengstrom.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/council-proposal-22-10-09.pdf) \n the references to \"extreme circumstances\", \"prior\" procedures and replaced the loop-hole for \"criminal offences\" - undoing all the work of the Parliament and delegation. Engstr\u00f6m summarised his response by saying that by this, the Council has shown \"utter contempt for Parliament by totally ignoring everything it says\".\n \n\n\n\n This proposal, if passed, would pave the way for more countries to institute procedures for cutting people off from the Internet without judicial process as France has already done (with the French Constitutional Court announcing its approval of the law the same day as the above incident). Could this mark the end of a free and open Internet? Pirate Party UK condemns this action and recommends that all relevant individuals contact their\n [representatives on the delegation](http://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/Telecoms_Package-Conciliation_Committe-Parliament_Delegation#Political_Memory:_MEPs_ranking_by_score) \n to remind them of their mandate to represent both the European Parliament (who voted for the original Amendment 138) and the people of the EU.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["3 Strikes", "EU"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/telecoms-package-failure-democracy", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140723071804/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/telecoms-package-failure-democracy", "date": "2009-10-23T00:00:00+01:00"}, "/blog/editor/dont-disconnect-us-brightdancing-test": {"state": "full", "title": "Don't Disconnect Us - Brightdancing Test", "body": "\n\n\n\n This is a test post to see if youtube works.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Video of SXG\\_aqRiJRA\n \n\n\n Talk Talk\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["test"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/dont-disconnect-us-brightdancing-test", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140723054055/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/dont-disconnect-us-brightdancing-test", "date": "2009-11-01T00:00:00+00:00"}, "/blog/editor/michael-geist-explains-acta": {"state": "full", "title": "Michael Geist explains ACTA", "body": "\n\n\n Professor Michael Geist of Ottawa University has produced a 20 minute talk introducing the Anti Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) -- the secret copyright treaty currently being negotiated, which threatens to destory our rights on the internet at the behest of greedy corporations.\n \n It's an excellent introduction to this dangerous secret treaty:\n <http://blip.tv/play/AYGusTsC>\n<http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/4530/125/>\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["ACTA", "michael Geist"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/michael-geist-explains-acta", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140723133430/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/michael-geist-explains-acta", "date": "2009-11-13T00:00:00+00:00"}, "/blog/editor/rms-talks-pirate-party-uk": {"state": "full", "title": "RMS talks to the Pirate Party UK", "body": "\n\n\n\n For nearly everyone reading this post, rms will need no introduction, so I'll just say that if it wasn't for Richard M.

After all, the EU and US enjoy one of the closest economic partnerships in the world and certainly the largest.\n   \n\n  \n\n If you look at the relationship in terms of bilateral trade, the picture is pretty clear with more than \u20ac2bn a day passing between the two in 2012. According to the Office of the US Trade Representative, transatlantic investment is directly responsible for around 6.8 million jobs. It is a relationship that has a broad impact. Not only does it help to produce economic prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic but also in dozens of other trading partners around the world.\n   \n\n  \n\n It is hard to argue that any measures that might make this partnership more efficient, or remove barriers to competition would not be a good thing. Of course, as with any relationship in which both sides are competing, the positive aspects come with a few negatives. Disagreements and tariffs may be minor but they do pose a barrier to access for both EU and US businesses. Current subsidies and state support ensure that in some areas competition is less than ideal, or even impossible.\n \n  \n\n And while it is probably true that some of these issues are protectionist in some way or intended to protect European or US industries, many of them are not. Limitations and barriers to competition when it comes to the export of agricultural products are a case in point, some are clearly intended to protect and subsidise producers. Others like limitations on the use of genetically modified organisms infesting the food chain and concerns about intellectual property reflect more serious concerns about accessibility, technology and safety.\n   \n\n  \n\n It is these differences between European and American approaches - everything from agricultural policy, chemical safety regulations, data protection, intellectual property and many more - that will become battlegrounds. This was acknowledged when International Trade Committee MEPs on Thursday warned European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht that hard bargaining would be needed to close a deal acceptable to the European Union public. And it is the public that need to be convinced.\n   \n\n  \n\n For it is the benefit of citizens that must take precedence over any other consideration, both in terms of jobs and economic wellbeing, and with regard to consumer and employee protections and civil liberties. It would be all too easy for the terms of any agreement to be directed by corporate interest. After all, business has an undeniable and large stake in trade issues. But that raises the spectre of an EU/US agreement with the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ACTA or the Stop Online Piracy Act like provisions tagged on at the behest of lobbyists and corporate sponsors. It raises the possibility that consumer, employee and environmental protections will be seen as inconveniences and be reduced rather than levelled between the two partners.\n   \n\n  \n\n It might even be hard for MEPs and national governments to object to what they might see as inconsequential or minor issues in particular areas when there is an entire trade deal, an agreement that has an impact on hundreds of billions of euros, at stake. Those of us who want to see a healthy relationship between the US and EU, who want to see unnecessary barriers reduced, have a responsibility to ensure that we look carefully at any proposals. We must act decisively when there are problems, however small they may appear, if they threaten the progress the EU has been making over the last decade.\n   \n\n  \n\n Above all it is vital that the negotiations are open, transparent and that those involved in them are accountable. That is not too much to ask and it is certainly achievable. We must of course stand against anything that erodes the protections that have been so hard fought and instead aim to extend those protections to the citizens in the countries we partner with. These negotiations, indeed the whole US-EU trade deal represent a massive opportunity in economic terms and in cementing real public involvement in our future prosperity, something to be grasped with both hands.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["TPIP", "Europe", "Trans-Pacific Investment Partnership", "Economics", "Trade"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/party-magazine/eu-us-free-trade-deal-must-not-diminish-european-standards", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140626163106/http://pirateparty.org.uk/party-magazine/eu-us-free-trade-deal-must-not-diminish-european-standards", "date": "2014-03-27T11:10:04+00:00"}, "/blog/loz-kaye/euro-candidate-vote-2014": {"state": "full", "title": "Euro Candidate Vote 2014", "body": "\n\n\n\n It's the run up \u00a0to the Euro Elections in May.

There\u2019s something undeniably sinister about these vast, faceless titans with their unfathomable methods and international reach; so much so that it\u2019s sometimes an effort to remember that, actually, they\u2019re the ones who develop and mass-produce the drugs we use to stay alive. For that we owe them thanks \u2013 but let\u2019s not get sentimental about it. These companies are still companies, and they have their own agendas and priorities, which often end up in conflict with those of the average mortal.\n \n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20140706063543im_/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/pills.jpg?itok=VLYt7oea)\n One instance of this conflict is the pharma companies\u2019 vice-like grip, via\n [patents](/party-magazine/drug-prices-are-harming-patients) \n , on the production of newly-developed drugs. This can put heavy financial pressure on health services, particularly in developing countries. Another conflict, which is the focus of this article, involves the publication of clinical trial data. Clinical trials are carried out on a massive scale as part of the process of bringing a new drug onto the market: the trials are meant to determine whether the drug is effective and safe, and whether patients would benefit from being prescribed it.\n \n\n\n\n The problem, as Ben Goldacre clearly demonstrates in his excellent book\n [Bad Pharma](http://www.badscience.net/books/bad-pharma/) \n , is that the decision whether or not to publish the results of a given trial is determined by factors that are anything but scientific. Most worryingly, there is a strong bias towards publishing only positive results: if a trial\u2019s results are negative, or inconclusive, there is a much higher likelihood that they will be stuffed into someone\u2019s desk drawer and never see the light of day. This isn\u2019t a problem that\u2019s unique to industry-sponsored studies, but it certainly seems to be much worse there: a\n [2006 review](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=522832) \n found that 78% of industry-sponsored studies showed positive results for the drug in question, while only 48% of independently-funded studies came up with a favourable outcome. Hardly surprising given that pharma companies stand to gain from presenting their drug in the best possible light, but deeply worrying.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The upshot? People die. It\u2019s been estimated that over 100,000 people died in the 1980s as a result of taking anti-arrhythmic drugs, prescribed in good faith and with the best of intentions. The crucial\n [study data](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8349379) \n that could have prevented this was simply not published until long after researchers realised what was going on. The problem is not in the past, either: this month, the Cochrane Collaboration published a\n [new analysis](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008965.pub4/abstract) \n showing that Tamiflu, a drug intended for the treatment of bird flu pandemics, had only a tiny effect, likely comparable to that of paracetamol. The British government has spent half a billion on stockpiling Tamiflu \u2013 money that could have been spent on drugs that actually do what they say on the tin, potentially saving huge numbers of lives.\n \n\n\n\n Crucially, the Cochrane study was only possible because of extensive campaigning for companies to release previously unpublished trial data. Goldacre and others have set up a campaign,\n [AllTrials](http://www.alltrials.net/) \n , aiming to make the results of all clinical trials publically accessible. This campaign received a huge boost earlier this month when the European Parliament\n [voted](http://www.votewatch.eu/en/clinical-trials-on-medicinal-products-for-human-use-draft-legislative-resolution-vote-legislative-re.html) \n , by an overwhelming majority (594 to 17), to adopt the new Clinical Trials Regulation, which essentially requires all new trials to be documented in the public domain.\n \n\n\n\n The new EU legislation, though welcome, doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re out of the woods by any means. For one thing, it only affects future trials, meaning that the hundreds of drugs that are currently on the market on the basis of a highly biased selection of data (like Tamiflu) are unaffected. For another, the legislation will only be meaningful if the EU takes measures to actually enforce it \u2013 which, as Goldacre documents in his book, has not happened with past regulations. Indeed, one of Goldacre\u2019s recommendations is that the EU should become \u201cless risible\u201d.\n \n\n\n\n So the\n [European Parliament\u2019s](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en) \n step in the right direction doesn\u2019t solve all our problems. However, clinical trial transparency is highly interesting as a case in which the EU can take action where the governments of individual European states are virtually powerless to, since the big pharma companies can outmanoeuvre them with ease. If the UK alone were to impose stricter controls on trial publication, for instance, these companies could simply move their operations elsewhere.\n \n\n\n\n If the EU as a whole makes such a decision, it is much more difficult for them to sidestep it, since they would be depriving themselves of a much larger market. Here membership of the EU has a clear benefit to its citizens \u2013 but of course the right people have to be in the parliament. Across Europe, no party has pushed harder than the Pirate Party to ensure open access to research data, since openness of knowledge is one of our founding principles. By contrast, it\u2019s interesting to note that four of the 17 \u201cNo\u201d votes were by UKIP MEPs; the other five were simply absent, including Nigel Farage.\n \n\n\n\n Clinical trials are an area in which free access to information is not just an abstract principle: it plays a crucial, practical role in saving untold numbers of lives. The Pirate Party is committed to such access \u2013 but in order to stand up to big bad pharma, we need to be able to take action at the European level.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["Drugs", "Pharmaceuticals", "Tamiflu", "Goldacre", "NHS", "Health"], "source": [], "url": "https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/party-magazine/clinical-trials-and-tribulations-role-europe", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140708134655/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/party-magazine/clinical-trials-and-tribulations-role-europe", "date": "2014-04-18T20:44:34+01:00"}, "/blogs/loz-kaye/help-put-more-pirates-european-parliament": {"state": "full", "title": "Help Put More Pirates In the European Parliament", "body": "\n\n\n### \n It's the European Parliament Elections.\n\n\n\n Defending free culture doesn't come cheap.

But when we elect our representatives at any level we are implicitly entrusting them with a certain set of powers and responsibilities. If they then want to change those powers and responsibilities, either by increasing them or by reducing them, it is only right that the voters should have a say in the matter.\n \n\n This holds if we want to shift responsibility for major areas of policy to a supranational organisation like the EU; it would also be true if, for instance, our representatives wanted to abolish the monarchy. Major welfare reforms, on the other hand, probably shouldn't be put to a referendum, since they don't involve a redefinition of the competence of our representatives: if a government does something we don't like to the NHS, it is still within the government's power to undo the change (at least in principle), and the normal response would be to vote for someone else at the next election!\n  |\n|  | \n*Editor:* \n*Is now an appropriate time to hold a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU? If so, why? If not, when would be?* \n |\n|  | \n George:\u00a0 It's as good a time as any, given that the issue is riding high in the public consciousness. The Eurozone can be regarded as a kind of failed experiment: we now know, since the crash, that monetary union without fiscal union has undesirable consequences (as many economists predicted).\n \n\n That means that the EU is at a crossroads, and many key players are pushing for greater integration in order to stave off this kind of problem in future. That sort of integration is something that the public ought to have a say in.\n  |\n|  | \n*Editor:* \n*Does the UK need to reform its constitution so that a referendum can bind Parliament? Are there other measures that could give the public greater control over Parliament between elections?* \n |\n|  | \n George:\u00a0 This is a big question. Realistically, any constitutional reform would require the UK to actually have a single, formal, written constitution, which it doesn't at the moment.\n \n\n Drafting such a constitution would be a massive endeavour, and I'm not sure whether it would be a good use of our representatives' time and energy.\n \n\n Plus it's worth bearing in mind that parliamentary sovereignty is really only an academic theory, with a debatable legal basis. I don't think there's any need for constitutional reform such that a referendum must bind Parliament, since no government is going to call a referendum unless it's fairly sure it can get the result it wants and a government that acted against the result of a referendum would have no hope of getting re-elected. Those two facts together basically ensure that referenda will be binding.\n \n\n Perhaps a more important innovation would be to allow the electorate to initiate certain kinds of referenda themselves if they collect enough signatures, as is the case in Switzerland. In the age of Avaaz, change.org, 38 Degrees and others, that could be really powerful.\n  |\n|  | \n*Editor:* \n*Is the UK's membership of the EU a real and significant issue facing the UK population, or has it been created by politicians as a way of distinguishing them from others to secure votes?* \n |\n|  | \n George:\u00a0 It's a real issue. It affects consumer rights, the economy, human rights... pretty much everything.\n \n\n The problem is that \"in\" vs. \"out\" is an overly simplistic way of looking at it. There are several important questions we need to ask: Is the EU working (for us, or for anyone)? If no, can we try to fix it? Are there bits of European integration that we want, and bits that we don't want? (The Schengen area, for instance, includes non-EU countries such as Norway and Switzerland but excludes EU countries such as us, and the EEA includes countries outside the core EU.)\n \n\n Though I support the idea of a referendum, I think it's na\u00efve to imagine that it will really solve anything either way. I'd urge the voting public to look beyond a party's stance on the in/out question. Whether or not there is a referendum, and whether or not we remain in the EU, how our representatives interact with others in Europe will continue to be a significant issue.\n  |\n|  | \n*Editor:* \n*Given widespread misinformation about the EU, and minimal focus within the media and major political parties on countering this, can the public be trusted to give an accurate, informed decision on such a complex issue?

The issues were put together by 38 degrees and included campaign topics and suggestions from their membership. The result of the vote there were six issues that 38 Degrees members wanted to prioritise, these were:\n \n\n\n* protecting our public services and environment from TTIP (The Trans-atlantic trade and Investment Partnership).\n\n\n* protecting our Bees from poisonous pesticides\n\n\n* cracking down on tax-dodging\n\n\n* protecting our private data through stronger rules on data protection\n\n\n* getting stronger employment rights for workers\n\n\n* getting stronger targets for reducing carbon emissions to protect our climate\n\n\n\n  \n\n On the 15th of May, 38 Degrees staff then approached us, and every other party standing candidates to be UK MEPs with their questions.\n \n\n\n\n We were asked for short statements on each item and, as we try to do, sent back our responses within a few hours.\u00a0 Of course condensing policy into a couple of paragraphs can be hard, but I think in most cases we did a good job in getting our positions across clearly (and of course backing them up with links to our policies!).\n \n\n\n\n With our responses, and those of the 9 other parties that took the time to respond 38 Degrees members were asked to rate each of the parties\u2019 responses out of 5 based on how well they addressed their concerns about the issues (\n [All the responses are available from 38 Degrees](http://blog.38degrees.org.uk/2014/05/21/where-uk-political-parties-stand-on-issues-important-to-38-degrees/) \n ).\u00a0 Now it's important to note that the party names were removed, so it was just about the positions expressed.\u00a0 The result was a scorecard ranking all 10 parties on the issues:\n \n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20140714100243im_/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/scorecard.png?itok=cH6_7PgO)\n  \n\n  \n\n Now obviously we were surprised to be ranked below Labour on Data Protection, maybe we should have been clearer! Yet we scored\u00a0higher than Labour on employment rights,an area where you would assume Labour would be strong - even if we do offer solid support for workers and Labour seem a little luke warm at times. But then the Liberal Democrats, and Labour appeared to score more highly than the Greens on Climate Change.\u00a0 It may well be that as parties closely associated with these issues, our responses weren't strong, we rely too much on perception and the belief that we make the case so often that we don't have to do it again each time we are asked. \u00a0We'll certainly be working hard to remedy that.\u00a0 However, we thought you'd like to see our replies too so they are included here:\n \n\n\n\n Our responses\n \n\n\n### \n Question 1\n\n\n\n  \n\n*How will MEPs from your party go about stopping the NHS, our welfare and the environment from being threatened by global trade agreements like the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)?* \n\n\n\n### \n Our Answer:\n\n\n\n The Pirate Party opposes TTIP. The root cause of our objection is the secrecy around TTIP.\n \n\n\n\n When coupled with a number of leaks that seem to suggest that the treaty will grant corporations and business interests benefits at the expense of consumers and citizens, it becomes clear that TTIP presents a real danger to society.\u00a0 We have additional problems with reported aspects of TTIP like ISDS and the possibility that the deal would be used to reduce measures intended to protect consumers.\n \n\n\n\n The Pirate Party and its sister parties across Europe already took the lead to defeat ACTA.\n \n\n\n\n You can take a look at our in depth look at TTIP here: <\n [https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/campaigns/issues/ttip-trading-away-our-rights](/campaigns/issues/ttip-trading-away-our-rights) \n >\n \n\n\n### \n\n Question 2\n\n\n\n  \n\n*What will MEPs from your party do to secure tougher regulations protecting bees from harmful pesticides?* \n\n\n\n### \n\n Our Answer:\n\n\n\n As a party we rely in evidence led policy making.\u00a0 Where there is evidence that pesticides or other chemicals, or indeed industrial or agricultural processes cause unacceptable harm to our environment and ecosystems we will act to ensure they are properly regulated or banned.\n \n\n\n\n Where the EU is unable or unwilling to act, we will work to ensure that the UK acts appropriately\n \n\n\n\n You can read more about our positions regarding the environment here: <\n [https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/policy/environment/home](/policy/environment/home) \n >\n \n\n\n### \n Question 3\n\n\n\n*Will MEPs from your party work to secure tougher EU targets on CO2 reductions to help tackle climate change?* \n\n\n\n### \n Our Answer:\n\n\n\n Yes. Our MEPs will work to ensure that we are dealing with environmental threats generally and the dangers posed by climate change specifically by either supporting or introducing the measures necessary to limit those threats.\n \n\n\n\n We have a responsibility to people in the UK, Europe and across the world to act.\n \n\n\n\n You can read more about our positions regarding the environment here:\u00a0<\n [https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/policy/environment/home](/policy/environment/home) \n >\n \n\n\n### \n Question 4\n\n\n\n*What will MEPs from your party do to strengthen employment rights protecting workers across the EU?* \n\n\n\n### \n Our Answer:\n\n\n\n As a party we have a commitment to protect the right of everyone to protest, assemble and strike. That includes the right to join a union and work together to improve employees' rights and working conditions.\n \n\n\n\n At the same time we have committed to ensuring that maternity and paternity leave are fair, pensions are protected, and whistle-blowers are able to speak out as well as other employee protections.\n \n\n\n\n Again, our party doesn't think that the job of protecting workers and wider society is one for the EU alone, this is an area where the UK can and should act in the interests of its citizens and lead the way in Europe.\n \n\n\n\n You can take a look at our social policy here: <\n [https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/policy-areas/social-policy](/policy-areas/social-policy) \n >\n \n\n\n### \n Question 5\n\n\n\n*How will MEPs from your party protect constituents\u2019 privacy by ensuring tougher laws on data protection across the EU?* \n\n\n\n### \n Our Answer:\n\n\n\n We will work hard for better data protection and to ensure that data is not shared without consent, nor shipped across borders to avoid regulation.\u00a0 One of the reasons the Pirate Party exists is to deal with digital rights, these issues have been part of our core since our foundation.\n \n\n\n\n An overview of our commitment to protecting privacy is available as part of our civil liberties policy here: ,\n [https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/policy/civil-liberties/respect-privacy](/policy/civil-liberties/respect-privacy) \n >\n \n\n\n### \n Question 6\n\n\n\n*What will MEPs from your party do to crack down on tax dodgers, ensuring everyone pays their fair share of tax?* \n\n\n\n### \n Our Answer:\n\n\n\n At the EU level, the party would work to ensure that tax evasion and unintended tax avoidance is not made easier through EU regulation.\n   \n\n Broadly however, taxation is a national issue. Our commitment in the UK is that we will work to increase penalties for engaging in schemes aimed to evade tax unlawfully.\n \n\n\n\n The penalty for tax evasion should be sufficiently punitive that getting caught\u00a0 outweighs the benefits of having engaged in evasion over a period of years.\n   \n\n Nationally the party would aim to bring in a Minister with a clear and specific responsibility for taxation, ensuring that it is absolutely clear where responsibility lies and preventing the kind of deals that HMRC have cut in recent years.\n \n\n\n\n All of our policies are available here:\n [https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/policy](/policy) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n So, there you have it. \u00a0I'd like to thank 38 Degrees staff and members for their efforts in putting this together, if it gets a few people voting who might otherwise not have, or means a few more people take a look at party policies it will have been a great success. \u00a0It is a shame that a number of parties didn't respond - it's important that people know where parties stand, or how their candidates are going to represent them.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["38degrees", "Policy", "Ideas", "European Union", "European Parliamentary Elections", "2014"], "source": [], "url": "https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/andy-halsall/scored-policy-38-degrees", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140708123025/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/andy-halsall/scored-policy-38-degrees", "date": "2014-05-22T00:38:07+01:00"}, "/blogs/mark-chapman/mark-chapman-its-time-get-message-out": {"state": "full", "title": "Mark Chapman - It's time to get the message out.", "body": "\n\n\n\n Last week 129 people put their X next to the Pirate Party logo (and my name) on the ballot paper in Lambeth's local elections. That's 129 people that wouldn't have otherwise had the opportunity to Vote Pirate.\n \n\n\n\n More than that 129 though, are the thousands of people in the area who now know about the party, even if only a little. Thousands of people who are more aware of some of the things that we are passionate about and are campaigning for. People more aware of the need for transparent and open government at all levels, with open access to government data.

That's why we need many more people to stand as candidates at all levels of government.\n \n\n\n\n By standing, not only do we give people the opportunity to vote for us - to say 'Yes, I believe in what you are saying, I believe that it is important and I agree with you' - but almost more importantly it gives us the opportunity to talk to them about the things that we think matter. To give us the microphone of publicity to speak to people.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Being a candidate was exciting, exhilarating, interesting and challenging all at the same time. The one unexpected thing that I found was the positivity of people's response when I said that I was standing, who I was\u00a0standing for, and what we were about as a party. From Conservative to TUSC, through Labour and Lib Dem - I had candidates for other parties saying 'Thank you for standing - you are talking about interesting and important things which aren't being mentioned by anyone else'. Friends in the area said 'Well done for standing - I couldn't do it, that sounds really interesting - anything that I can do to help?'\n \n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20140703152013im_/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/MC1.jpg?itok=_vM1dEW-)\n What I found by standing was that people are receptive to a new politics and willing to talk about it - I found very little negativity from people and much more curiosity. As a candidate, not too much was required of me other than a willingness to talk about the party and what we believe in to those people that ask. Even the hustings event which I thought would be daunting was much the same - 'what do you think about\u2026' type questions rather than any directed criticism. Yes, it took up some of my time - in planning, in delivering leaflets (with a great deal of help), in attending a hustings event, but it wasn't excessive and was easy enough to plan around.\n \n\n\n\n If you were to stand as a candidate in your area, then thousands of people local to you can hear about Pirate Policies and why we think that they matter. It's a message that we think is important. It's time to get that message out.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["Lambeth", "London", "Elections", "Candidates"], "source": [], "url": "https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/mark-chapman/mark-chapman-its-time-get-message-out", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140708133128/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/mark-chapman/mark-chapman-its-time-get-message-out", "date": "2014-05-29T23:35:05+01:00"}, "/party-magazine/take-your-phone-holiday-well-almost": {"state": "summery_only", "summery": "", "url": "https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/party-magazine/take-your-phone-holiday-well-almost", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140708123354/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/party-magazine/take-your-phone-holiday-well-almost", "title": ""}, "/blog/w-tovey/does-life-mean-life-fight-over-whole-life-tariffs": {"state": "full", "title": "Does Life Mean Life? - The Fight over Whole Life Tariffs ", "body": "\n\n\n\n As has been widely reported, the Court of Appeal has approved the use of \"whole life tariffs\" for murderers, seemingly contradicting the European Court of Human Rights. But as the reporting seems to miss some of subtleties of the judgment it is worth a closer look.\n \n\n\n\n tl;dr: the ECtHR thought English law was unclear as they were getting different messages from the Government and Courts - the Court of Appeal said this was fine as the Government was wrong and could be ignored.\n \n\n\n\n The full judgment from the case is available here:\n [R v McLoughlin [2014] EWCA Crim 188](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2014/188.html) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n Sentencing, Tariffs and Murder\n\n\n\n When an individual is convicted of a crime, they are given a sentence. If custodial, it will be a number of years - the maximum the person can spend in prison (unless something else happens). The judge can also set a tariff; the minimum time the person must spend in prison before they are eligible for parole - release from prison with conditions attached.\n \n\n\n\n A person sentenced to 10 years in prison may be given a 5 year tariff and only spend 5-6 years in prison. However, for the remaining 4-5 years they will be subject to the terms of their parole and can be recalled to prison if needed.\n \n\n\n\n Murder is an unusual offence; following the abolition of the death penalty, it carries a mandatory life sentence. Someone convicted of murder must spend the rest of their lives under the sentence; either in prison or on parole. In such cases the judge must set a tariff; either of a fixed number of year or a \"whole life tariff\" - meaning that the prisoner will never be eligible for parole. These are reserved for the most \"heinous crimes.\"\n \n\n\n\n There is one way of being released under a whole life tariff; the Secretary of State - usually the Home Secretary - can allow the release of someone under a whole life tariff on compassionate grounds, in exceptional circumstances. In the \"Lifer Manual\" (\n [Prison Service Order 4700](http://www.justice.gov.uk/offenders/psos/pso-4700-indeterminate-sentence-manual) \n ) the Government set out the circumstances in which they would exercise this power, limiting it to very narrow cases where prisoners are seriously or terminally ill and would be safe to release. This power to release was the key issue in these cases.\n \n\n\n## \n The ECtHR's Ruling in Vinter\n\n\n\n The issue of English whole life tariffs came before the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights, who gave their ruling in July 2013. The full judgment is available here:\n [Vinter and Others v The United Kingdom [2013] ECHR 645](http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2013/645.html) \n\n\n\n\n In this appeal three prisoners under whole life tariffs argued that the scheme was a breach of Article 3 of the Convention; amounting to inhumane or degrading treatment. The ECtHR emphasised that for a prison sentence to be compatible with Article 3 there must be \"a prospect of release and a possibility of review,\" but they noted that there was nothing wrong with whole life tariffs being imposed by judges at sentencing or with prisoners never being released - provided there was some hope for rehabilitation.\n \n\n\n\n The ECtHR made it clear that the criteria in the Lifer Manual were far too restrictive and the Court was not convinced that these situations - where the prisoner was likely to die imminently - actually counted as release. For whole life tariffs to be acceptable under Article 3, the grounds need to be broader.\n \n\n\n\n The ECtHR found that the legal position on what counted as \"exceptional circumstances\" was unclear. On the one hand there was the Lifer Manual, issued by the Government, which set very narrow grounds for release. On the other, there was a ruling by the English Court (in R v Bieber [2008] EWCA Crim 1601) stating that as Government was bound by the ECHR if Article 3 required that prisoners under whole life tariffs be released, they had to allow the release, and that the Government had the power to do so.\n \n\n\n\n It was this lack of clarity that led to them finding the scheme in breach of Article 3.\n \n\n\n## \n The Court of Appeal in McLoughlin\n\n\n\n This case involved a second set of prisoners; one challenging their whole life tariff (Newell) and the Attorney General challenging a trial judge's refusal to impose a whole life tariff on another (McLoughlin).\n \n\n\n\n The Court noted that the ECtHR had no problem with whole life tariffs in principle, provided that was some way to reduce them. In the Court's opinion, the ECtHR's problem was the lack of clarity coming from the fact that the Government had not revised the Lifer Manual after the previous English Court rulings - creating two different sets of criteria for release.\n \n\n\n\n But the Court of Appeal said this was wrong; there was no confusion. The law is the law, and the Government, in exercising its discretion to allow the release of people under whole life tariffs, must act compatibly with Article 3. If this meant that they had to release prisoners in circumstances other than those listed in the Lifer Manual, they would have to do so. The Lifer Manual was not an Act of Parliament and merely said that they would release people in those specific circumstances. If the Government did not review cases appropriately, this could be brought before the courts in a judicial review.\n \n\n\n## \n Winners and Losers\n\n\n\n So who won the case?\n \n\n\n\n The Government and much of the UK press have been portraying this as the Government's victory over the ECtHR. But I'm not convinced that is the reality. While the Government won the actual case (Newell's whole life tariff was upheld and a whole life tariff was imposed on McLoughlin), they may have lost the legal principle.\n \n\n\n\n The Court of Appeal, while disagreeing with the ECtHR on the minor point as to how clear English law was, still agreed with their general principles. Whole life sentences must have the \"prospect of release and a possibility of review\" in a broad set of circumstances - the Lifer Manual is not sufficient and the Courts may challenge the Government if it refuses to change.\n \n\n\n\n As to what will happen now, that is unclear. The Government might accept this ruling and change their policy - making both the domestic courts and the ECtHR happy. This case might be appealed and the Supreme Court could be left to decide who is right, what amounts to inhumane and degrading treatment, and what, in its opinion, the ECtHR rulings in Vinter actually meant. The issue could end up back in the ECtHR, who could decide whether this ruling has clarified the law enough for them. Or we could see the Government refusing to change their policy and prisoners bringing judicial reviews of potentially inhumane or degrading decisions.\n \n\n\n## \n The Right to Hope\n\n\n\n Some people may argue that the underlying issue is simple; some prisoners should never have the prospect of release. On that, I will quote from Judge Power-Forde's concurring opinion in Vinter:\n \n\n\n\n> \n>  The judgment recognises, implicitly, that hope is an important and constitutive aspect of the human person. Those who commit the most abhorrent and egregious of acts and who inflict untold suffering upon others, nevertheless retain their fundamental humanity and carry within themselves the capacity to change. Long and deserved though their prison sentences may be, they retain the right to hope that, someday, they may have atoned for the wrongs which they have committed. They ought not to be deprived entirely of such hope.

An interesting thing about social media platforms (e.g.\n **[https](https://www.facebook.com/)**\n[://www.facebook.com/](https://www.facebook.com/) \n ) is that they cannot be selectively blocked by filtering technologies when accessed over SSL (HTTPS). Unfortunately, parents may erroneously believe they are effectively protecting their children from such advertising. Their own websites may be blocked, but in the mean-time, drinks brands can be marketed with impunity to anyone with a Facebook account unless you also blanket ban all social media sites.\n * Blocked:\n <http://www.bacardi.com/uk/>\n* Not blocked:\n <https://www.facebook.com/pages/Barcardi-Breezer/>\n\n\n## \n File Sharing\n\n\n The campaign against file sharing on the internet pre-dates the web filters and is a service about which Pirate Party UK has actively campaigned; including\n [running our own proxy service](http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-ban-rockets-pirate-party-website-into-the-big-time-120518/ \"Opens in new window\") \n , initially in solidarity with our sister parties and latterly to attempt to contest the legality of the media industry dictated blocking regime. Unfortunately, the financial cost to the individuals, even when backed by the party and donations, was too great to effectively complete this challenge and proxy sites for accessing 'blocked' sites are\n [still to be contested in court](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20782529 \"Opens in new window\") \n .\n\u00a0\nIn the mean-time, technology websites like\n <http://bittorrent.com/>\n and\n <http://www.utorrent.com/>\n are blocked, as well as an extended (but not comprehensive) list of bittorrent and proxy sites, however traffic for downloading via peer-to-peer networks is not blocked, nor are other services such as IRC chat.\n\u00a0\nAt the time of writing, the popular software development site\n <http://sourceforge.net/>\n has even been blocked by (BT's) 'File Sharing' category, along with similar file hosting services such as CNet's download.com - even the popular file-sharing news site Torrent Freak was\n [blocked by Sky](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/10558473/Sky-updates-porn-filter-after-blocking-legitimate-sites.html \"Opens in new window\") \n for several days.\n\u00a0\nThe dangers of these filters, once again, is both they can be a dangerous blunt instrument to apply to huge swaths of internet real estate, and that they offer the illusion of effective control to parents who do not understand the complex legal and technical landscape of this area.\n ## \n Gambling\n\n\n The gambling industries have gone from strength to strength since the rise of the internet. Formerly the pastime of the anorak-wearing in the seedy local highstreet, bringing gambling to people's homes has captured the time, imagination and wallet of the UK consumer like never before. The financial dangers and psychologically addictive effect of gambling has led to government regulation and caution. But not on Sky Broadband!\n\u00a0\nUnsurprising, since\n [Sky Betting and Gaming division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Betting_and_Gaming \"Opens in new window\") \n spans multiple sites and services - which\n [cannot be blocked](http://helpforum.sky.com/t5/Broadband-Talk-Questions/Sky-Broadband-Shield-and-blocking-gambling-sites/qaq-p/1483865 \"Opens in new window\") \n on Sky Broadband. Who knew Sky were so anti-censorship?\n ## \n Games\n\n\n Of course, once again, websites in the format\n **[http://latestonlinegame.com](http://latestonlinegame.com/)**\n will be blocked and\n **<https://www.facebook.com/lastestonlinegame/>**\n will not be blocked.\n\u00a0\nIt's unclear the scope of the blocking (of course); whilst some mobile ISPs have been known to block services like Steam and Minecraft, most do not. It's unclear whether this would affect use of e.g. Netflix and other services integrated into consoles.\n\u00a0\nBT's filters\n [do, however, claim](http://bt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/46809 \"Opens in new window\") \n to block access to app stores (itunes/google play/kindle store etc) -\u00a0 removing users' ability to patch and update their applications, leaving them vulnerable to malware and other online threats. Thanks, BT!\n ## \n Cyberbullying\n\n\n Cyberbullying is a major concern of today's parents, much like bullying has always been - but with children now able to interact directly with both classmates and strangers through their computers and mobiles from their bedrooms, it's very important that children and their parents are able to effectively deal with harassment through programmes of education.\u00a0 Platform providers such as Facebook,\n [Twitter](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/aug/30/twitter-report-abuse-button \"Opens in new window\") \n and even\n [Ask.fm](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/children_shealth/10225846/Cyberbullying-suicides-What-will-it-take-to-have-Ask.fm-shut-down.html \"Opens in new window\") \n have implemented tools to report abuse, despite reports to the contrary.\n\u00a0\nOnly Sky Broadband claims to be able to block cyberbullying; with the remaining ISPs presumably realising that bullying is not a concept which can be blocked at the network level.\n\u00a0\nUnfortunately for Sky customers, they may get the impression this is possible to do via these filters.\n ### \n In part two, I will look at the blocking of Pro-Ana Content, Sex Education, Web-blocking Circumvention, Esoteric Material, Extremist and Terrorist Material, as well as conclusions which can be drawn from my research.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["Censorship", "Web Filtering", "File sharing", "Web Blocking"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/chris-monteiro/inside-default-web-blocking-part-1", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140706063330/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/chris-monteiro/inside-default-web-blocking-part-1", "date": "2014-01-17T16:14:00+00:00"}, "/blog/ed-geraghty/week-looking-forward-physical-nec-meeting": {"state": "full", "title": "This week: Looking forward to Physical NEC Meeting", "body": "\n\n\n This week's update will be as much about looking forward at the next few weeks as it will be looking back at the past one\n [1](/blog/2014/jan/13/week-looking-forward-physical-nec-meeting/)\n .\n\u00a0\nOne of the most important fixtures in the NEC calendar is the annual full-day NEC physical meeting, and this year will be no exception!\u00a0 These physical meetings allow the NEC to set the tone for the coming term\n [2](/blog/2014/jan/13/week-looking-forward-physical-nec-meeting/)\n , and are incredibly productive as an in-depth dialogue between the various teams within the party\n [3](/blog/2014/jan/13/week-looking-forward-physical-nec-meeting/)\n .\u00a0 This year's meeting will be held in Sheffield on the 18th of January.\n\u00a0\nAs I mentioned in last week's post, work is still ramping up around EU Elections activity, expect to hear more information in the coming days.\n \n We are also on track with our new web site;

They're inexperienced, they've come late to the digital fight, they're a little too, well, green. I say this as someone who joined the Greens hoping they were a truly progressive party but left when there was a completely void of support for our digital freedoms.\n   \n\n  \n\n As it was put by a co-host on The White Rose Club radio yesterday \u201cGreens are like 3G and the Pirate Party are 4G\u201d which I think captures it perfectly. Essentially while there is a faction within the Greens that know there is something in the digital world that needs their attention, they're most certainly not up to date while Pirates are at the frontier.\n   \n\n  \n\n The second question I get asked is:\n   \n\n  \n\n \u201cIf you're determined to be a Pirate, then why not stand on a joint-ticket?\u201d\n   \n\n  \n\n Of course this is in reference to the recent motion the Greens passed to allow joined candidates. Many Greens have expressed their excitement for a \u201cGreen Pirate\u201d candidate. However, in Wales and especially in Bridgend where I am standing, this is met with heavy resistance. It would seem the Welsh Green Leader Pippa Bartolotti, perhaps to some degree feels neglected by the main Green Party entity after they joined the anti-austerity alliance. There is an undertone that Welsh Green votes will be traded in to Plaid Cymru for greater support for Greens in England. For this reason they are overly-aggressive towards \"the other\".\n   \n\n  \n\n This is not the only reason. In order to consider a joint ticket the Greens would need to want to save our digital environment with the same bravado that they do with our physical environment. Until that happens Pirates would be weighed down, dragging the Greens up to date. In my Bridgend constituency the Green Party candidate does not even have an Internet connection, which has harmed his own campaign by preventing him from signing the frack-free promise to Greenpeace.

It was called \u2018Downloaded\u2019 and was essentially the story of the rise and fall of Napster. It was pretty interesting, but there were a couple of things said on it that I wanted to address in more detail.\n \n\n\n\n First, there was a record company executive who claimed that the job of the Record Labels was to be a guarantee of quality - that if you saw the name of the Label on the sleeve, you knew it had to be good, since that label didn\u2019t sign rubbish.\n \n\n\n\n That may have been true in the 1950s and 60s (I couldn\u2019t tell you for certain - I wasn\u2019t around), but it sure as hell isn\u2019t true now. Record labels are now all owned by a small collection of massive conglomerates like Warner Music Group, and they have no interest in the quality of the product, they only care if the product makes them oodles of cash.\n \n\n\n\n Not only that, but the record industry has deliberately set things up so that they can screw the musicians signed to their labels out of as much money as possible. They\u2019ve arranged it so that an album can go double-platinum, but due to \u2018creative accounting\u2019, the album won\u2019t \u2018make a profit\u2019 so no royalties go to the artists.\n \n\n\n\n Then there\u2019s the collection agencies - they\u2019re the people who get licensing money from things like music venues and radio stations. In theory, the money collected is supposed to go to the artists who are signed up with the collection agency (paying a fee for the privilege, of course). In practice, not every artist gets a cut of this pie. In practice, the vast majority of the money goes to the \u2018big-name\u2019 famous artists, and nothing to the smaller names who are trying to get their foot in the door. The collection agencies carry on hoovering money out of artists, venues, radio stations (of the online and offline variety) and cheerfully luring more aspiring musicians in with promises of royalties which they never receive, meaning that smaller names end up effectively subsidising the already famous and wealthy names at the top of the tree.\n   \n\n Sound suspiciously like a pyramid scheme? You aren\u2019t the first to notice, but sadly, this is all 100% legal.\n \n\n\n\n So, lets talk about Napster. I mentioned at the beginning of this post that I watched a documentary called Downloaded. I was struck at one point by the founders of Napster talking about what they had originally intended for their product. They had thought that once they got the network of users hooked up, once they had a big enough user base and proven technology, they could take it to the record industry and say \u2018Check out what we made! Look at how great a distribution system this is!\u2019.\n \n\n\n\n We could have had iTunes (without the walled garden and bloated client software) way back in 2000 had the record industry realised that. Instead of an opportunity, they saw a threat, and the response to that threat was to kill it with every weapon at their disposal. I don\u2019t know about you, but that makes me incredibly sad.\n \n\n\n\n The record companies have no reason to change, to seek out new business models and innovate, because they are already the lords of all they survey. So anything that comes along to threaten that position, they fire with both barrels, blaming anything other than themselves. When they couldn\u2019t keep up with the idea of digital distribution, they screamed \u2018Piracy!\u2019 and persuaded lawmakers, governments and musicians that the evil pirates were trying to kill the industry.\n \n\n\n\n Many musicians believed that rhetoric that the reason they weren\u2019t seeing profits from their hard work was due to evil music pirates and not deceptive industry accounting practices. They began to attack their own fanbases with accusation of music piracy, in some cases even filing lawsuits against some of their biggest fans. Meanwhile, the music industry continues its shady practices, laughing all the way to the bank while frustrated artists shoot their own foot off.\n \n\n\n\n If musicians are not getting fair pay for the work they are doing, then that is the fault of the industry and the business model and accounting practices it adheres to, it is not the fault of fans who just want to listen to their favourite music.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": [], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/rebecca-hill-duty/lets-talk-about-music-industry", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160619162339/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/rebecca-hill-duty/lets-talk-about-music-industry", "date": "2015-03-10T16:04:22+00:00"}, "/speech/loz/kaye/think-different-vote-different": {"state": "full", "title": "Think Different?

If only I had a Bitcoin for each time I've been asked \u201cWhy are you in the Pirate Party?\u201d Somebody even recently phrased phrased it \u201cWhy did you attach yourself to the Pirate Party?\u201d.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I don't think this is a question that Tories or Labourites tend to get asked. Like they are the obvious political choice to make.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Perhaps it's obvious to most people why you prefer to choose a well trodden political path.\n \n\n\n\n Perhaps it's obvious why you might compromise your beliefs in the pursuit of power.\n \n\n\n\n Perhaps it's obvious why you might put tactics above conviction.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n But it has never been obvious to me.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170614113942im_/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/Party_You_Believe_In.png?itok=P1lW9fNV)\n My answer to \u201cWhy are you in the Pirate Party?\u201d has always been a version of, because it's where I feel at home.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We're not bogged down with old fashioned ideology, trappings of old ways of doing things which are so off putting to voters.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Our brand of politics is needed more than ever.\n \n\n\n\n That's true because we get the issues like digital rights that others have only just started to understand. But it runs deeper than that.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Time and again people we meet tell us that they are fed up with politicians, they feel betrayed, they have no voice, they are not represented, their ideas are ignored. For all that British politics has changed hugely with the rise of 4 \u2013 5 even 7 \u201cmain\u201d parties now that view has not gone away.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Whether it's UKIP or the Greens, they still seem to be in the business of imposing a world view on voters and not really listening.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Personally, coming up to a General Election certainly brings home how far we have come, and how much I have changed and learnt over these 5 years. 5 years that have felt way too long at times as we've seen civil liberties attacked, the opportunity to change our political system squandered, local government funding slashed creating growing inequality across the country, access to justice undermined, none of the deeper problems that followed the economic chaos of 2008 addressed.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The General Election of 2010 is where I came in. I joined in March 2010 on the back of the Digital Economy Act controversy and just days later found myself being an election agent! I remember getting a mail from Tim Dobson and thinking \u201chow hard can that be\u201d! Well it proved to be a little more complicated than I imagined, but from that point I knew I had found my political home.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Yes, that home has been hard won and we are still building it. But coming round again now I am proud of what we have achieved and that we are coming in to General Election 2015 prepared in a way that obviously a party just months old could never have been.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I look back on the joyful enthusiasm and passion of 2010 and well I like to think I still have that, but tempered with knowledge, experience and supported by a great team.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I'm really looking forward to this election and sharing that with you.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n But before we look forward to that a little look back.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2014 saw significant steps forward for Pirate Party UK as an organisation.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We stood in the European elections in May 2014 in the North West region, fielding a list of excellent candidates Maria Aretoulaki, George Walkden and Jack Allnutt. This gave the largest ever number of people the opportunity to vote Pirate in the UK \u2013 over 5 million.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The European elections were by far the biggest ever logistical undertaking by PPUK. The mailout alone saw 400,000 leaflets printed and distributed to homes in Manchester, Salford, Warrington and Liverpool. We have learnt from previous years and have now identified the right suppliers to make sure this type of operation runs smoothly, setting us up for General Election 2015.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In other words, no more activists sitting in somebody's lounge putting leaflets in to bundles with countless elastic bands.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We were praised (even by other parties) for the quality of our social media output, visual material and videos. The material for the \u201cknow us, like us, vote for us\u201d campaign was also taken up by other Pirate Parties Europe wide and shared widely. We undertook our biggest ever crowdfunding campaign, which was a significant success clearing the \u00a35,000 target. We broke new ground in British politics by accepting Bitcoin which allowed us to achieve this goal.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We continued to establish ourselves in new areas. For the first time we contested for council within London, and Mark Chapman was ratified as General Election candidate for Vauxhall constituency.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The autumn saw the opening of the first Pirate Party office at Islington Mill, Salford. This was the realisation of a commitment made by the National Executive to professionalising the party. It was abundantly clear that it will be impossible to move forward from the current position without doing so. Already, the gathering of party assets and establishing a clear base has transformed the work of the National Executive.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n All in all, 2014 saw us establish the organisational base needed to challenge effectively in 2015. Yes it's not all stuff that makes the political heart beat faster, but it is fulfilling the challenge I set out back in 2011 when we first had a gathering like this .\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n That challenge was whether we really meant it \u2013 whether we wanted to take the business of politics seriously. Because I knew that this would cease be my political home if we didn't mean it seriously.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Well 2014 proved that we do mean it, in spades, both politically and organisationally.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It's time for me to set out that challenge again I think.\n \n\n\n\n Do we mean this project?\n \n\n\n\n Do we want to step forward from where we are now ? Because that is what I want.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n That is what I want us to use General Election 2015 to do \u2013 to move us up and really set our our political stall.\n \n\n\n\n We need to hack the General Election \u2013 as it were.\n \n\n\n\n We have to take our core issues and make them concrete for the broadest possible public.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We all too often hear that supposedly the British public are indifferent to the privacy and mass surveillance issues. The campaign we ran on the attempt to staple the Communications Data Bill \u2013 or \u201cSnoopers' Charter\u201d in to another law showed that was not the case. People responded in droves. Purely personally I know this was the biggest ever response I had via social media in all the time I have been campaigning on these issues.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Let's set it out once again. We are citizens not suspects. There is no justification for blanket warrantless surveillance. It doesn't make us safer. Quite the reverse. Recent comments by David Cameron on encryption are making us more vulnerable. There is no such thing as a \u201cback door\u201d for the good guys. Just a door anyone can use. Worst case scenario is \u2013 Cameron would be willing to risk ISIS seeing your bank details.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We must oppose the return of the Snoopers' Charter. We must get to the bottom of the current surveillance programmes like TEMPORA and PRISM. We must have transparency about the funding of these capabilities.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As for so called 'piracy', we have shown time and again we are right and been constructive. But also clear about what must happen next.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The biggest flaw of the 'anti-piracy' lobby is that they have never been able to set out what a positive outcome would look like. In of itself reducing filesharing doesn't put any money in any artists' pockets, it doesn't create jobs, it doesn't promote culture, education or sport.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We know this from Norway where a dramatic fall in filesharing by the under 30s from 80% in 2009 to 4% 2014 has not resulted in a rise of music industry income at all, once inflation is factored in.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In fact, in the UK the 'war on pirates' has been directing money away from artists and legitimate policing priorities.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Where I live in Ancoats there was serious concern about crime last year- there were reports of people threatened with a gun on the street where I live. Residents were told there were no more resources for community policing. Yet, just up the road in Cheetham Hill the copyright cops swooped in on a premiere league streaming site.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The copyright cop organisation PIPCU must be disbanded. Its \u00a33 million pounds funding must be targeted on supporting victims of violence and abuse. I want a 21 person team dedicated to that, not worrying about 1 Direction downloads.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This government set aside \u00a33.5 million for a copyright promotion programme, more than the latest round of culture department cuts which saw respected arts companies axed.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This white elephant propaganda programme must be cut and the national arts portfolio expanded.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What happened in Norway, I think points to the future. We have won the argument- the key thing we have been saying all along was that easier, affordable, abundant and timely access to content was what people have been wanting. But that when that is available there is no magic new pool of vast amounts of money that would flood in to the music or film business. People's income won't allow it and the economy simply doesn't work that way.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n That's why the Digital Economy Act's controversial parts must be dropped, and its successor the VCAP programme stopped. It is simply fighting a non existent battle of the past. Nevertheless we have got through all of this parliament without the blanket attacks envisioned in the DE Act.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We won that point. We got what we wanted. Yes it was with others- but we made the crucial point digital rights are a political issue.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n That's not to say there won't be new challenges to digital rights from big content. The eye-watering \u00a35.1 billion new premiere league TV deal means that football will be the new front in the pirate wars. The premiere league must not make the mistake of the BPI and the MPAA and start harassing fans simply for posting Vines of goals.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We must be there to insist that if there are billions for investment for the world's richest league from the likes of Sky + BT, they should also be able to shoulder billions for investment in digital infrastructure. If there are billions for the tops clubs there should be money for grassroots football, there should be a commitment to a living wage for all staff at stadiums, the whole community must benefit from regeneration around sports facilities not just a privileged few.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Despite new challenges opening up, quietly, our views are being accepted \u2013 certainly priorities are changing. Even just 5 years ago being online was seen as a bit of an add on extra . That there was a digital economy as well as a regular economy. Now there is just the economy, and if you aren't online, if you don't have digital skills, you can't participate in it.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The latest Lords report on digital skills calls on the Internet to be recognised as a utility and for universal access.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This must be at the heart of education, local government, DEFRA, BIS and DCMS policy:\n \n\n\n\n Internet provision as a utility and access universal.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n To achieve this, the next round of digital infrastructure funding must not end up just being a leg up for BT. Then we really do risk falling foul of state funding for business regulation. It's time to focus on innovative providers, and to remove the ridiculous red tape that is preventing a level playing field for the smaller companies who are really in touch with local needs and can provide services for cheaper.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n But as we have acknowledged, we must broaden out from our core issues. This is why the current members and candidates are with us. We must have a distinctive take on anything the voters want to know about.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n If this election will be about anything it will be about health and the NHS. We have a commitment to the NHS and treatment free at point of delivery. We don't want to see the NHS undermined by the international TTIP agreement.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It has always been our party's view that pharmaceutical giants are the big barrier to affordable and innovative care for the public. In America in 2012 24% of sales dollars was spent on marketing versus 13% on research and development. The extraordinary thing is no other parties are dealing with the drug patent issue which allows this. It's only us who are highlighting this as an election issue.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Already our candidates have received hundreds of emails on tax evasion.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The recent HSBC \u201cSwissleaks\u201d tax avoidance scandal has been shocking in its scope, but sadly not surprising. We in the Pirate Party expect business to do their bit like the rest of us to support the NHS, education and pensions.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tax avoidance is created by the complicated loopholes set up over many years of budgets and laws. That's our responsibility of all of us standing for parliament.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I'd be happy to support a Tax Dodging Bill that does all you want and eliminates one of the key dodges which means corporate giants can move money out of the country. Big companies like Starbucks pay a \u201croyalty\u201d to themselves for using their trademark, which means they can pretend they have made no profit, when in fact they are just paying themselves. Let's stop using royalties and intellectual property to dodge taxes.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We should widen the scope of the already existing general anti-abuse rule . The government estimated this would recover between \u00a340 million to \u00a385 million per year over 5 years. But War on Want estimated broadening the rule could recover as much as \u00a35.5 billion every year.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n On education, we stand for scrapping University tuition fees. If anything has damaged young peoples's trust in politics it is this issue.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Here's the bottom line. The Tories and LibDems want students to pay \u00a39K. We want them to pay \u00a30.\n \n\n\n\n The Labour party want students to pay \u00a36K. We want them to pay \u00a30.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Education must be a life long right and enthusiasm. Let teachers teach, nursery teachers nurse, not get bogged down in administration.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We must remove discrimination against young people from the benefits system. We would not accept this for any other group. Thinking that younger people are less worthy of being paid fairly or having the same support from welfare is as offensive as it is wrong.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We are glad to see the support gathering around votes at 16. I hope it will be passed in the next parliament. The Scottish Independence referendum showed young people can be passionately involved in politics if the are given the chance.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Our biggest job this election will be to send out the message that voters need to trust their convictions and not be scared in to the so-called obvious political choices.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It has already started. Electors are being told vote UKIP and you'll get Labour. Vote Labour and you'll get SNP. Vote SNP and you'll get Tory. Vote Tory and you'll get UKIP. And round and round again.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Well, shall we try this? :\n \n\n\n\n The only way to get what you want is to vote for what you want.\n \n\n\n\n The only way to get something different is to vote for something different.\n \n\n\n\n Have done with it , to get Pirate, vote Pirate.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Think different? Vote different. Vote Pirate.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We have to tell people if they even care slightly about Snowden or Manning they have to consider putting a mark next to one of our candidates. Otherwise issues like surveillance, transparency, whistleblowing, the wars in Iraq + Afghanistan will constantly be consigned to the \u201cdoesn't matter\u201d pile in MPs minds.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We have to tell people if you want Lords reform, PR, constitutional change don't vote for any of the parties that are currently in Westminster \u2013 they had all the opportunities for change over the last 5 years and failed to deliver.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sure, we won't be standing in all constituencies, nothing like. But everyone wherever they are can help out, even just lending a tweet, contributing to policy, promoting our crowd funding.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n All those talking of wasted votes, two horse races, x can only win here, there is only one way to oppose Labour/Tories do not believe in democracy, just aggressive marketing. They believe their entitlement to power is more important than the issues that you care about.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n When politicians tell voters that there is no real choice, is it any wonder that people switch off ? When politicians hold out thinking differently is something dangerous, is it any wonder that they can't think differently when confronted by new problems?\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We must offer the real alternative \u2013 daring to be different, daring to be hopeful about the future. Our society is so full of inequality. I believe the current government is increasing that, and that the Labour party doesn't offer the prospect of fundamentally altering it.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n But the one moment we do have the same power, where all our opinions are weighed equally is that fleeting moment in the ballot box.

You can register to vote if you are:\n \n\n\n* over 16 (but you cannot vote until you are 18)\n* a British or Commonwealth citizen, a citizen of the Irish Republic or other European Union state\n* not otherwise disqualified from registration.\n\n\n### \n How to register\n\n\n\n You can register to vote by following the guide on the\n [Electoral Commission's dedicated website .](http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/) \n\n\n\n### \n How to Vote\n\n\n\n**Voting in Person** \n - if you are registered to vote, you can go to your local polling station on polling day. They are open between 7am and 10pm and you do not need your polling card to cast your vote. If you are disabled and need assistance, you can contact your local electoral registration office and you can also ask to have a companion with you, or the staff in the polling station may be able to help.\n \n\n\n\n**Voting by Post** \n - to vote by post, you need to fill in an application form. You don't need a reason to vote by post (unless you're in Northern Ireland). Your postal vote can be sent to any address you give, including overseas. Please make sure there will be enough time to receive and return your ballot by polling day - they are sent out a week before polling day and must arrive by 10pm of the day to be counted.\n \n\n\n\n**Proxy Voting** \n \u2013 you can have a proxy vote if you cannot get to the polling station on polling day. This is where you appoint somebody to vote for you. They then go along to your polling station and cast your vote. The deadline to apply for a proxy vote is no later than 5pm on the sixth working day before polling day, except in cases of medical emergency, when you can apply until 5pm on polling day.\n \n\n\n\n**Postal Proxy Voting** \n \u2013 if your proxy is going to be away from home on the day of the election, they can apply for their proxy ballot paper to be posted to them.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": [], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/campaigns/issues/general-election-2015", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150416204535/http://pirateparty.org.uk/campaigns/issues/general-election-2015"}, "/party-magazine/why-its-good-be-right-making-impact": {"state": "full", "title": "Why it's good to be right - Making an impact.", "body": "\n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20141019044130im_/http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/PRISM.jpg?itok=m1jgOiBV)\n We often talk about the progress the party is making and the things we want to change, but beyond some of our larger national successes we don't say as much as we could about when we do make an impact. \u00a0Its time to change that, so:\n \n\n\n\n It is starting to feel like we are making real progress on some of our\n [core issues](/policy) \n - maybe not as much or as quickly as we might wish, but enough to show that we can be a real force for change, now!\n \n\n\n\n In\n [Manchester](/) \n , we have been facing off with the Labour Party in elections for the best part of 4 years on a raft of\n [local issues](/manchester-manifesto/) \n , including\n [digital](/manchester-manifesto/digital-rights/) \n . It's significant, then, that this week Manchester Labour have decided that they finally want to follow our lead and push for\n ['Better Broadband](/2014/04/03/success-as-councillors-forced-to-act-on-betterbroadband/) \n ' in the run up to the local elections! \u00a0Granted, they have been a bit slow off the mark and in the past have been dismissive of such issues, but we have shown them the way and they are now at least talking about it... and it is an important issue.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Video of aDuYB-w9wbI\n \n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20141019044130im_/http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/Leaflet-1.png?itok=KdaZV166)\n Ever since we started campaigning in the centre of Manchester, we have highlighted the importance of everyone being able to\n [take part in the digital revolution](/2012/03/17/open-manchester/) \n . Loz Kaye, Maria Aretoulaki and Tim Dobson all called for support to create world-class infrastructure in their city; infrastructure for everyone, not just for businesses or those in better-off areas. In fact, as far back as 2012, Manchester Pirates were calling for both homes and businesses to be included in fibre broadband roll-outs.\n \n\n\n\n It\u2019s good to see that as well as now campaigning for improvements, Labour recognise the current situation - that the digital infrastructure they have been responsible for delivering is, in their own words, \u201c\n [just not acceptable](http://citycentrelabour.org.uk/broadband/) \n \u201d.\n \n\n\n\n Of course, at this point their response is just a petition for BT to step up and deliver, but now that they have accepted the problem we know we can demand more from the ruling party in one of Britain\u2019s Digital Cities.\n \n\n\n\n For us, the next step is making the case for rolling out public WiFi, and ensuring access reaches out to the poorest communities in the city - those who need it most. It's an argument we can win, and one we have to win if we want everyone to grasp the advantages that the digital revolution offers.\n \n\n\n\n However, it's not just in Manchester where we are starting to bring pressure and see results. \u00a0Yesterday saw the European Parliament\n [vote to secure net neutrality across the whole EU](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26865869) \n - albeit as part of a\n [Telecommunications regulation package](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-373_en.htm) \n . The vote was overwhelming in its support for the measures, and will leave the EU in a far better place as well as benefiting consumers.\n \n\n\n\n Those few that did oppose the measures, or even parts of them, (including North-West Labour\n [MEP Arlene McCarthy](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/2173/ARLENE_MCCARTHY_home.html) \n ) now seem to be feeling the pressure. There are suggestions that voters will shift their support to parties who support freedom and sensible digital policy, abandoning those on the wrong side of the digital debate.\n \n\n\n\n This is what we exist for. We have shown that we can directly influence the direction of our governments at every level by challenging politicians on the ground, in the media and in elections. We can force them to take into account the issues we know have to be dealt with when they run and develop policy. Most importantly, if they fail to make the right decisions we can take them on directly because our ideas and principles apply both online and off.\n \n\n\n\n Openness, Privacy, Inclusion and the ability to share online are all huge issues. I'm looking forward to seeing more of this as we run our\n [European election campaigns](/campaigns/european-elections-2014) \n and I hope that you can\n [get involved](/campaigns/volunteer) \n or\n [support us too!](/donation) \n The more help we get, the more we can do.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["Broadband", "Net Neutrality", "Pirate Party", "Success"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/party-magazine/why-its-good-be-right-making-impact", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150416204535/http://pirateparty.org.uk/party-magazine/why-its-good-be-right-making-impact"}, "/campaigns/issues/fund-manchester": {"state": "full", "title": "Fund Manchester", "body": "\n\n\n## \n Help Give Manchester a Different Voice\n\n\n\n It's time for Manchester Central to have an independent voice.

Whilst ostensibly requested for \u2018security\u2019 reasons (being played up again in the light of the Charlie Hebdo murders in France) \u2013 this mass retention of data is nothing less than oppressive, unwarranted, mass surveillance of the entire populace.\n   \n\n  \n\n We know all too well from the Snowden revelations that power is abused by those who hold it \u2013 and that there is mission creep in the data retained and the uses to which it can be put. There is no reason to think that this would be any different.\n \n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n  \n\n Previously the bill had been rejected in scrutiny by a joint committee of the Lords and Commons for a variety of reasons - amongst them the fact that the Home Office had totally underestimated the cost involved as well as the lack of any evidence that there is any benefit to be had by requiring ISPs to hold this data. It was also requested that the Independent reviewer on Terrorism legislation, David Anderson, reviewed and commented on the bill and Parliament is still waiting for his response to the initial proposals.\n   \n\n  \n\n Given all that, it is shocking and simply unacceptable that four unelected Lords are attempting to pass this draconian legislation, not in its own right, but as a late amendment to a current bill. It is a total abuse of parliamentary procedure and means that this legislation will not suffer the intense scrutiny that a new bill would, but instead would be passed in a backhanded fashion without review and consideration by both Houses.\n   \n\n  \n\n The House of Lords is intended in our parliamentary system to be a \u2018revising chamber\u2019 \u2013 adding a totally new bill as an amendment to an existing one completely goes against that entire principle. The very fact that they feel it is necessary to bring the bill in this underhand manner shows that they clearly don\u2019t have any faith in the ability of the legislation to stand up to proper scrutiny.\n   \n\n  \n\n The rushed passing of the\n [#DRIP](https://twitter.com//search?q=%23DRIP) \n legislation set the worrying precedent for this kind of action by parliament when seeking to pass contentious legislation that avoids scrutiny. As a party we warned of the dangers of Parliament passing controversial and oppressive surveillance laws without appropriate time or scrutiny. Despite the calls of both ourselves and others, that bill passed into law.\n   \n\n  \n\n We cannot let the same thing happen here.\n   \n\n  \n\n We must act and we must act now.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": [], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/mark-chapman/snoopers-charter-zombie-bill-won%E2%80%99t-go-away", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150314225459/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/mark-chapman/snoopers-charter-zombie-bill-won%E2%80%99t-go-away", "date": "2015-01-23T10:06:13+00:00"}, "/blogs/mark-chapman/vatmoss-vatmess-why-politicians-need-understand-digital-businesses": {"state": "full", "title": "#Vatmoss #Vatmess - Why politicians need to understand digital businesses", "body": "\n\n\n\n So on the 1st January next year one of the less well thought through set of EU rules comes into being. The VAT rules on digital products and services are changing such that VAT is applied based on where the\n *purchaser* \n of a digital product or service is based rather than where the\n *supplier* \n is based.\n \n\n\n\n\n What might appear on the surface to be a small technical change actually has really big consequences for both digital privacy, as well as for small businesses and entrepreneurs.It will now be the responsibility of the business to \"locate\" their end customer and verify this location in order to apply the correct VAT rate to the digital service. This is the first issue that jumps out at me - if I am downloading an app, how are they (supposed to be) tracking where I am so that they can apply VAT correctly?\n \n\n\n\n According to the rules the business is expected to collect 'two pieces of non-contradictory evidence' which can include IP address, stated physical location, country of credit card used etc. In order to satisfy such regulatory requirements, businesses large and small are likely to reduce the ability and incentive of customers to use anonymous payment methods - there is less point in using Bitcoin to pay for something if you still need to provide credit card details to prove your location. This is clearly a negative for internet freedom and shows a total lack of understanding of the anywhere, anytime principle of digital goods and services and tries to force a physical offline principle of 'location' into an online world where it is not normally present.\n \n\n\n\n As a comedic aside and to highlight the absurdity there is a great example in this City AM article (\n [http://www.cityam.com/1412620320/london-s-thriving-tech-sector-under-thr...](http://www.cityam.com/1412620320/london-s-thriving-tech-sector-under-threat-bonkers-eu-vat-reforms) \n ): \"On board transport travelling between different countries in the EU (for example, by boat or train), the consumer location will be the place of departure for the consumer's journey. This means a French person travelling from London to Paris by train, having passed through the Channel Tunnel, could purchase an online subscription, connecting to the French mobile network, with a French IP address, and using a French credit card, but it would be correct for VAT purposes to show this as a UK customer. Getting this wrong risks an unlimited fine, even though the VAT rate in both countries is 20 per cent.\"\n \n\n\n\n Secondly, and in some ways more importantly even for consumers, is the effect on businesses, and particularly small businesses. In terms of the details - the new rules apply to any business (including sole part-time traders) that supply software, images, music or apps for download to customers in the EU and critically there is no lower threshold. This means that mum's who write and sell eBooks as a light income generating hobby, online cartoonists, or schoolboy developers selling Wordpress themes all suddenly have a responsibility to be registered for VAT if there is the possibility of selling 1 item outside the UK but within the EU. Historically there has been a VAT Exemption Threshold so that you didn't have to worry about VAT until you got to a size where you could afford an accountant. This strips that away and means that this will be devastating to those small businesses not yet making enough money to be able to afford to deal with this. Equally, it sets a very high barrier to digital businesses from starting up in the first place - entirely contrary to the spirit of the internet which should be about opening up markets and possibilities for all.\n \n\n\n\n There are meant to be 'one stop shop' solutions - so for example you can register in the UK instead of all 28 EU countries individually, but that is still a administrative burden considerably above what there is at present for micro-businesses which fall below the Exemption Threshold.\n \n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20150316043702im_/https://london.pirateparty.org.uk/files/2014/12/vatmoss.gif)\n And if you are a micro-business potentially caught out - what is the solution? Well as the excellent cartoon from online cartoonist Dave Walker, (at\n <http://davewalker.cc/vatmoss-cartoon/>\n ) illustrates - none of the options are great, and most people appear to be trying a combination of 1) (Don't sell outside the UK) and 5) (Ignore it as it's such a mess anyway). Clearly that is not advice - and politically we should be campaigning and petitioning to re-instate the lower threshold so that only businesses that can afford to deal with VAT registration have to do so.\n \n\n\n\n Almost as interesting though is the process by which this came about - given that anyone who buys or sells online on a regular basis would be able to highlight the gaping problems around location identification - it says a great deal about European Politicians not understanding the online world at all and attempting to regulate it in the same manner as offline.\n \n\n\n\n Similarly the lack of comment on the issue from UK politicians shows the lack of awareness of the impact on digital small businesses - exactly those businesses which Osborne claims to be supporting, but is doing nothing to help when they meet head-on a genuine current issue.\n \n\n\n\n Both of these points continue to highlight the need for the Pirate Party and what we are doing. They highlight the desperate need for politicians who understand how the internet works and aren't afraid of it - who recognise the importance of digital micro businesses and are actually listening to real issues instead of focusing on coming up with meaningless soundbites.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": [], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/mark-chapman/vatmoss-vatmess-why-politicians-need-understand-digital-businesses", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150315001029/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/mark-chapman/vatmoss-vatmess-why-politicians-need-understand-digital-businesses", "date": "2014-12-15T23:04:14+00:00"}, "/blogs/andrew-norton/human-rights-no-corporate-rights-yes": {"state": "full", "title": "Human Rights No, Corporate Rights Yes?", "body": "\n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20150315200654im_/http://pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/campaigns_material/previews/TTIP.png?itok=8sn1xzFa)\n It\u2019s become a hallmark of British Government that they say one thing and do another. Rarely is it ever so cut-and-dried as with the current\u00a0Conservative government.\n \n\n\n Much has been made over the last few weeks about the desires of the Prime Minister to\n [leave the European Court of Human Rights](https://pirateparty.org.uk/press/conservatives-increase-government-power-scrap-hra) \n (ECHR). Cameron has said he wants to bring more powers back to London, because\u00a0he doesn\u2019t like the way it \u2018hands power\u2019 off \u2013 powers we British have given to that court more than 60 years ago. Most notably, he doesn\u2019t like the way it often deals with his right wing agenda of\n [disenfranchising people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirst_v_United_Kingdom_(No_2)) \n , and\n [creeping towards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_and_Marper_v_United_Kingdom) \n a police state, but seems to be championing the way with\n [misinformation](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/six-things-you-should-know-4370967) \n .\n \n\n\n\n\n It\u2019s quite surprising to note then, that he has not been an outspoken critic of the Transatlantic Trade & Investment Partnership (TTIP) or the Comprehensive \u00a0Economic and Trade \u00a0Agreement (CETA) which was\n [released yesterday](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf) \n . In fact, he has been portrayed as a\n [massive supporter](http://canadianawareness.org/2012/01/david-cameron-pushing-ceta-in-davos/) \n of the TTIP, and CETA.\n \n\n\n\n \u201cWhy is that surprising?\u201d, you might ask, and the answer is simple. The entire thrust of his anti-ECHR campaign, has been that the court takes power \u2018out of London\u2019. He has no problem with \u2018Human Rights\u2019, but wants to somehow\n [bring it entirely inside the UK](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/03/uk-britain-europe-rights-idUKKCN0HS0GQ20141003) \n , no matter the outside cost (there may well be\n [significant consequences](http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jul/15/dominic-grieve-warns-uk-withdrawal-human-rights-court-echr) \n to leaving the ECHR). In essence, he wants a UK subservient\n [only to UK judges](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-29466113) \n .\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n However, both the CETA and TTIP contain a provision called \u201cInvestor-State Dispute Settlements\u201d or ISDS. These allow for a company to sue a country if it feels its laws are harmful to that company\u2019s interests. If you don\u2019t understand how that works, here\u2019s two examples.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In Canada, drug company Eli Lily has\n [filed suit against Canada](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/eli-lilly-files-500m-nafta-suit-against-canada-over-drug-patents-1.1829854) \n after patents on two of Lily\u2019s drugs were invalidated. These patents were invalidated by Federal courts. Lily is suing for \u2018loss of investment\u2019 under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n \n\n\n\n\n In Australia, the Hong Kong subsidiary of tobacco company Phillip Morris\n [sued Australia](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-04-17/plain-packaging-heads-to-high-court/3954122) \n for the plain packaging legislation enacted\n [by the Australian government](http://www.ag.gov.au/tobaccoplainpackaging) \n . Morris is suing under the 1993 \u2018promotion and protection of investments\u2019 treaty between the two countries.\n \n\n\n\n Obviously, the first case is of significant interest to the Pirate Party, in that invalidating useless patents is one of the things we strongly support. However, it\u2019s the second that is of greater interest here. Mainly because plain-packaged tobacco is one of the issues David Cameron is quite keen on, and which has gone through a number of consultations and studies.\n \n\n\n\n If he\u2019s upset at judges in Strasbourg enforcing a set of laws and practices based on human rights, because it\u2019s \u2018not British\u2019, the uproar at the CETA should be deafening. After all, in those disputes, judges are not used at all. In both the Australia, and Canada cases, the country picked one arbiter, the suing company picks another, and a third party picks a third. They\u2019re not even judges, but commercial arbiters, who operate in a market environment, and thus have a financial interest in the litigation (who will hire an arbiter that won\u2019t side with you?). Thus the case ends up being pivotal on the arbiter selected by this third party.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In fact the CETA specifically adds cases and circumstances where countries will be subject to decisions by Arbitrators - not even judges, certainly not UK judges. And this is all one-way as well. Companies will be able to sue the UK, but the UK can\u2019t use this back at countries.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CETA is a huge gift to businesses of a way to protect their profit-making if pesky things like \u2018judges in London\u2019 aren\u2019t going to rule their way should \u2018politicians in London\u2019 make a democratic decision in the interests of the UK. And yet he has a problem with judges in Strasbourg ruling on rights because they\u2019re in Strasbourg and not London?\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The treaty now released to the public view for the first time in 5 years is now 'finished' - there is no negotiation, or admending. It is a straight \"yes\" or \"no\" on the treaty as a whole, and\n [only the Germans](http://rt.com/op-edge/191768-eu-canada-ceta-agreement/) \n have\n [raised any objections](https://www.opendemocracy.net/ournhs/jurgen-maier/battle-royal-in-brussels-backroom-'trade'-deals-under-fire) \n , almost entirely to do\n [with ISDS](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/09/25/new_german_objections_threaten_canadaeu_trade_deal.html) \n . It's not the only such treaty either, as the TTIP (which is\n [just like CETA](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/what-is-ttip-and-six-reasons-why-the-answer-should-scare-you-9779688.html) \n , but between the EU and the US) also has\n [similar ISDS clauses](http://www.eurasiareview.com/22092014-assessing-regulatory-impact-transatlantic-trade-investment-partnership-ttip-analysis/) \n .\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n And if that doesn\u2019t show Cameron\u2019s protests against the ECHR for the nonsense it is, then nothing will. These treaties, which have been backed by Cameron for the entire length of the current government, not only reduce the power of the government, but give that power to corporations in the name of economic growth, because we know just how well the kind of economic growth this encourages works. All to the wealthy friends of the PM, and little-to-none to the government or the general public.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["ECHR", "TTIP", "CETA", "Europe", "United Kingdom", "Human Rights", "Trade", "European Union"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/andrew-norton/human-rights-no-corporate-rights-yes", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150315001339/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/andrew-norton/human-rights-no-corporate-rights-yes", "date": "2014-10-08T21:26:35+01:00"}, "/blogs/mark-chapman/ukip-and-pirates-%E2%80%93-opposites-or-2-sides-same-coin": {"state": "full", "title": "UKIP and the Pirates \u2013 Opposites, or 2 sides of the same coin?", "body": "\n\n\n\n Politics is never as Black and White as people perceive it, or as the media portray it. We in the Pirate Party know this \u2013 that is one of the reasons we are Pirates and don\u2019t fall into the traditional lazy left vs right paradigm. It is equally easy though to dismiss other parties which you think \u2018clearly we would never agree with them\u2019, and this can be equally wrong. I want to take a few moments to look at the \u2018new force\u2019 in British Politics \u2013 UKIP, and see what we as a small party can learn from them, and explore where we are tapping into the same ideas in different ways.\n \n\n\n\n Firstly, let\u2019s look a bit closer at UKIP and understand what or who they actually are. It is easy (and lazy) to portray UKIP and their supporters as \u2018backward-thinking\u2019, \u2018dinosaurs\u2019, or even as David Cameron put it \u2018closet racists, fruitcakes and loons\u2019. This is to misunderstand both what they stand for, but more importantly where the people that vote for them are coming from. Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford in their book \u2018Revolt on the Right\u2019 have taken a look at UKIP supporters and identified a large number demographically as \u2018the left behind\u2019. That is, people that feel that society and the world has moved on and they are left behind \u2013 socially, financially, culturally, politically. This is why UKIP are managing to perform the seemingly impossible \u2013 to challenge both the Tories and Labour at the same time. This is exemplified in the upcoming by-elections on the 9\n th \n October, Clacton \u2013 traditional Tory pensioner seaside town almost certain to vote UKIP, and Heywood and Middleton \u2013 traditional Northern Labour working class seat which is looking like a much closer fight than you might initially expect. The brilliant\n [@election\\_data](https://twitter.com/election_data) \n has done demographic analysis of both seats on his\n [blog](http://election-data.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/heywood-middleton.html) \n and highlighted in Clacton the elderly, middle and upper working-class retiree\u2019s, and in Heywood the traditional blue collar workers. These are people that are traditionally very loyal and which both Labour and the Tories have up until now been taking for granted. They are finding in UKIP a political party which is prepared to listen to their concerns and purports to share them.\n \n\n\n\n Well so what \u2013 these voters are never going to be attracted to the Pirate Party are they? There are surely so many things that we disagree on \u2013 Gay Marriage, Immigration, Europe, Votes at 16 \u2013 to say nothing of digital rights or web-filtering. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t things to be learnt. As voters they are tempted by UKIP because they are saying in effect \u2018it\u2019s OK \u2013 we understand that you are scared by the modern world and we will protect you from it\u2019. UKIP are offering to these voters an expression of their dissatisfaction and disillusionment. And this is where I would argue that we could be considered as 2 sides of the same coin. For we too in the Pirate Party are disillusioned and dissatisfied with politics and society as it is at present. We too believe that the current way in which we \u2018do\u2019 politics needs to change \u2013 that we need to go back to what democratic engagement was originally about \u2013 individuals coming together to improve the society in which they live. It is noticeable that unlike any of the \u2018big\u2019 parties \u2013 we were positive about Douglas Carswell\u2019s decision to resign his seat and re-fight it \u2013 giving the choice back to the voters where it belongs, and not taking them or their votes for granted.\n \n\n\n\n So where do we go from here? Well if we identify similar issues to UKIP, we differ greatly in our solutions. If UKIP is the party that accepts fear of the future, and whose solutions are backward looking, then we are the party that is optimistic about the future and wants to take people forward. Instead of being fearful of modern life and trying to reverse it, we are looking ahead and trying to embrace it. In the history of mankind there has never been a time when trying to prevent technological change was successful \u2013 what needs to happen is for us to recognise it, understand it, and harness it for the good of society as a whole.\n \n\n\n\n And for those people who might be attracted by what UKIP are saying? Well we need to show people why they can, and should, be optimistic \u2013 we need to show people the amazing and positive things that the future can hold if we embrace it, engage with it and understand it. It is a politics of leading people in the right direction, instead of frightening them back to a safe corner. It is a politics of embracing change, instead of resisting it. It is a politics of the future, and not the past. It is - at its most fundamental - the politics of being a Pirate.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": [], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/mark-chapman/ukip-and-pirates-%E2%80%93-opposites-or-2-sides-same-coin", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150314225849/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/mark-chapman/ukip-and-pirates-%E2%80%93-opposites-or-2-sides-same-coin", "date": "2014-09-24T18:15:09+01:00"}, "/blogs/editor/time-parliament-act-mass-surveillance": {"state": "full", "title": "Time for Parliament to act on Mass Surveillance", "body": "\n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20140826213250im_/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/campaigns_material/previews/GoVote_3.png?itok=TEFnOqDs)\n We hear all the time that the British public don't care about mass surveillance, privacy and Edward Snowden, but we know that's not true.

I interpret that to mean that individuals (including officers) can use party resources (primarily the website) to disseminate information about how to support Gary's campaign but that party will take no position on Gary's case as a party. Individuals give support to Gary in their own name and not the party's. There is also no expectation that anybody must or should be active in campaigning for Gary, and hence it is down to a personal choice. The party's role will just be to facilitate the sharing of information on how to support Gary.\n\n\n* Most of the membership does believe that the impact of cross-border law and changes in extradition should be incorporated into our formal policy-making process. The scope of the party's agenda has been clarified to embrace these topics, even though they are not obviously part of the 'three pillars' of policy.\u00a0 We will hence include relevant policies in our manifesto. WilliamFS, manifesto coordinator is tasked to impartially consider how to incorporate the topic within our existing policy formulation framework.\u00a0 The membership was also generally supportive of the suggested outline policy-cum-press release, and this will serve as a starting point for both drafting policy and drafting public communications about it.\n\n\n\n Thanks again to everyone who has contributed their opinions.\u00a0 The exercise has been a model for how to intelligently debate the real issues and seek a compromise that best represents the wishes of the party's membership.\u00a0 The greatest concern was with extending the party's scope beyond the three pillars.\u00a0 Speaking personally, I'm generally inclined to keep the party's scope narrow and not extend beyond the three pillars, especially when we have so much work to do to settle core policy.\u00a0 Hopefully those of you who would have preferred to exclude cross-border laws and extradition from scope can accept that I would not make lightly recommend an extension to scope.\u00a0 However, in this one instance, it appears to be appropriate and consistent with the overall ethos of a party sensitive to the key issues that need to be addressed in the era of the internet.\n \n\n\n\n Let us move forward and do what we can to enshrine justice in our legal system.\u00a0 Nobody wants to see the kind of injustice that Gary McKinnon faces.\u00a0 As individuals we can play our part in helping Gary.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the party can work to ensure that arbitrary foreign laws do not hang over the heads of every British citizen who ventures on to the internet.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["Gary McKinnon", "Extradition"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/mckinnon-laws-cross-borders-and-pirates", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150315054544/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/mckinnon-laws-cross-borders-and-pirates", "date": "2009-10-29T00:00:00+00:00"}, "/blog/editor/your-approval-new-positions-trust": {"state": "full", "title": "Your Approval for New Positions of Trust", "body": "\n\n\n\n Members of the Pirate Party UK, we would like your approval to appoint people to new positions of trust. \u00a0Why do we seek your approval?

The record labels create, press, distribute, and sell the CDs, but do not obtain the necessary copyright licences.\n>    \n> \n>   \n> \n>  Instead, the names of the songs on the CDs are placed on a \"pending list\", which signifies that approval and payment is pending.\u00a0 The pending list dates back to the late 1980s, when Canada changed its copyright law by replacing a compulsory licence with the need for specific authorization for each use.

These have been made in the relevant regional forum, as I've been inviting them to be posted there because in the first instance it's relevant to see what members in the region, in particular, make of the proposed candidacy.\n \n\n\n### \n Deadline for application\n\n\n\n You must post your candidacy proposal by\u00a0Saturday 20th March\u00a0to be considered, and you must also have joined the party.\n \n\n\n\n We anticipate that the final round of candidate ratification will open for member voting on\u00a0Monday 22nd March.\n \n\n\n## \n Who will be funded\n\n\n\n If everyone who has shown a definite interest to me in standing for Parliament puts themselves forward, we could have more candidates endorsed than we presently have funding to put up. This will be good, if so, because it may be that we can secure funding in time, and it would mean we already have endorsed candidates standing ready.\n \n\n\n\n However, unlike the first round, this may mean we have to make a decision about which of the candidates we actually fund, if we do hit that limit, and we will need to figure out how to make that cut. I'm open to suggestions on how we do that, I can see possible ways to do it, with both advantages and disadvantages. I'm aware, for example, from the potential candidates who have been discussing the possibility of standing with me, that there could be particular reasons to want to fight a given seat, or put up a particular candidate.\n \n\n\n\n This will perhaps be clearer by Saturday, when we'll know who has put themselves forward, and also the endorsement vote may be one way for the membership to send a message about which potential candidates are preferred; I'd suggest that discussion and commentary about that during the vote would also be very helpful, once we know how many candidates have put themselves forward, who they are, and where they wish to stand.\n \n\n\n## \n Local elections\n\n\n\n Finally, I'd like to re-state that we are also keen for as many people to stand in the local elections as possible, and if you are a Pirate member in good standing, you wish to stand in your local council elections on May 6th, and there isn't any contention between you and another Pirate in the same local area,\u00a0then we will endorse you as a PPUK local candidate.\n \n\n\n\n You will need to take the initiative in organising that, and making the arrangements with your local electoral office; we will provide endorsement of your candidacy, and support you as far as we can; local campaigning if you undertake it will be very much in your hands however.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["Candidates"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/candidates-2010-last-call", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150419211325/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/candidates-2010-last-call", "date": "2010-03-16T12:15:00+00:00"}, "/blog/editor/digital-economy-bill-has-passed": {"state": "full", "title": "The Digital Economy Bill has passed", "body": "\n\n\n\n So.

Unfortunately they failed, because politicians don't listen to reasoned argument, and care more about corporate interests than the rights of the British people (there are a few honourable exceptions, for example Tom Watson).\n \n\n\n\n\n In truth the strategy for waiting for a measure such as the DE Bill to be proposed, and then campaigning against it, was always likely to fail in the long term, because even if the bill had failed, the corporate interests behind it would have resurrected the proposals in a different guise -- for example in the ACTA treaty, or though European legislation. The corporations would only have to succeed once to win, but the digital rights campaigners on the other hand would have to win every time.\n \n\n\n\n I think a different strategy is needed. We need a political party that:\n \n\n\n* will put this issue center stage\n* will get lots of people to vote for it\n* will get its people elected\n* will persuade the other parties that taking away people's internet rights is a massive vote loser\n* will not just prevent laws from being enacted that take away people's internet freedom, but will actively get laws passed that extend freedom\n* and by doing all the above, will beat the corporate interests behind the DE Bill.\n\n\n\n Fortunately such a party already exists, the Pirate Party. Everyone who cares about these issues should join it. (If you doubt the truth of this assertion, just ask yourself what would IFPI, the BPI, the RIAA, or the MPAA want you to do? Would they want you to join the Pirate Party, or would they prefer it if you despondently admitted defeat and gave up?)\n \n\n\n\n Together we can and will win.

I started writing this in Stockholm after being invited to the official election campaign launch for Sweden's Pirate Party. It was their success in '09 that kickstarted so much interest in the Pirate Party movement.\n \n\n\n\n So it was good to take a moment to remember that.\n \n\n\n\n But also it was worth taking a step away from the already poisonous atmosphere in the run up to the European elections in Britain. Other British party leaders chose to kick their campaigns off bickering with their enemies. We chose to kick it off talking with our friends out in Europe about what we have achieved.\n \n\n\n\n And the Pirate Party has delivered way more for the British people than UKIP has for instance. And that's even without any British MEPs. Think what we could achieve with a candidate like Maria Aretoulaki in Brussels.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20141017173027im_/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/1485-Anna%20Troberg%20%26%20Loz%20Kaye_foto-Stefan%20Roudn-medium.jpg?itok=jZEbyboG)\n We have defeated ACTA, we've stood up to back room deals, we've protected access to the Internet, we've got the Commission to take the issue of broadband speeds seriously, we've set the agenda on all our core issues.\n \n\n\n\n Also, it's good to get the outside perspective on Britain's relation to the EU. Many people I talked to talked about \u201cBritain's referendum on EU membership in 2017\u201d. It seems that people throughout Europe are more clear that this is going to happen than a lot of UK politicians. I did explain that a referendum is not a done deal yet. But far from being concerned our Swedish colleagues are looking forward to a positive opportunity for reform.\n \n\n\n\n As Christian Engstrom MEP pointed out the EU structures are like an old car in constant need of patching up, but in the end you can't keep patching up what has rusted away. So much of the good work that has been achieved in the Parliament can easily be swept away by unelected forces.\n \n\n\n\n But what is needed is not arguing about a ragbag of individual (or an \u201cexception for the British sausage\u201d as Christian put it), it is working to a more open, democratic and transparent Europe that will benefit us all.\n \n\n\n\n Until we face this head on the uncertainty will continue, real dissatisfaction and alienation will grow.

Start off with a few \u201cisn't it amazing what the kids can do nowadays\u201d generalities to show you are vaguely with it. Then do a nod in the direction of the economic benefits technology can bring, to keep business happy. That leaves you clear to get on to the meat of what you really want to talk about \u2013 how the Nettywebz are a Pandora's box of terror, abuse, threats to citizen's rights, and moral dissolution.\n   \n\n  \n\n So it has proved with the much trailed speeches by the Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and the LibDem Leader Nick Clegg respectively. In particular, Cooper's speech is so packed with web cliches that it is clear that the Labour top remains fundamentally anti-Internet in its outlook. There are too many lazy conflations to mention, Facebook and NHS data are lumped together for example. She refers to the \u201cdigital challenges of the last 12 months\u201d regarding mass surveillance. I have no idea what this means specifically, and I suspect whoever wrote it doesn't either.\n   \n\n  \n\n To cut through the padding, the heart of what they set out to address, was surveillance in the light of the Snowden revelations. I want to focus on the substance \u2013 such as it is \u2013 of what they said and proposed, rather than how it was sold to the media.\n   \n\n  \n\n The fact that they are discussing this at all shows that it is beginning to filter through to politicians that they can't ignore the gravity of the serious breaches of trust that have taken place. That's in no small way thanks to all the work of grassroots digital rights and privacy activists over the months. And of course Edward Snowden himself, whatever Cooper might claim to the contrary. To be fair, this is some kind of progress.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Setting the background, both Cooper and Clegg bring up the state of the debate about the capabilities of the intelligence agencies. The shadow Home secretary claims that debate has \u201cbarely begun\u201d. She should not mistake the unwillingness of MPs to hold the state to account for a lack of debate or concern in the wider public. There have been endless column inches, each new detail in the Guardian minutely examined in social media, a Pirate Party petition with 10s of 1000s of signatures, demonstrations, public meetings, a law case launched with crowd funding, an Edward Snowden mural in Manchester in the vein of what you expect to see in Belfast for heavens sake...\n \n\n\n\n Clegg by contrast accepts there has been discussion, but describes the debate as \u201ccaricatured in a way that I believe is neither helpful, nor allows us to make progress\u201d, that it has been conducted purely in terms of \u201cgood and evil\u201d. I am not sure who he has in mind here, it sounds like an attack on the Guardian, the Open Rights Group, Big Brother Watch and others. At no point have any of us claimed that the raft of intelligence programmes were \u201csolely for the purposes of social control\u201d as the DPM puts it. It is him who is guilty of caricaturing the debate here. All any of us have been trying to do, for months now, is to set out what the situation is given what the PRISM, TEMPORA, XKEYSCORE, Optic Nerve (etc etc) revelations actually contain. The Guardian, Greenwald and others have set out in sober detail the functioning of a surveillance state, for all that Mr Clegg would have it otherwise.\n   \n\n  \n\n Wading past quotes from John Stuart Mill and all the rest, between the two of them the concrete proposals are as follows:\n   \n\n  \n\n Cooper:\n \n\n\n* Overhaul the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) \u2013 strengthen technological competence, appoint a chair from an opposition party.\n* Overhaul the system of independent oversight commissioners, consider a post of Inspector General of the intelligence services.\n* More public oversight \u2013 including media interviews and transparency about the role.\n* Review of RIPA \u2013 including warrants and the implications of servers on foreign territory.\n\n\n\n  \n\n Clegg:\n \n\n\n* Overhaul the ISC \u2013 increase numbers, appoint a chair from an opposition party, set budgets for 5 years.\n* Overhaul the system of independent oversight commissioners, appoint a post of Inspector General of the intelligence services.\n* Initiate a RUSI expert panel in to the principles behind intelligence gathering.\n* A web portal on the work of the intelligence services: surveillance.gov.uk .\n* Changes made to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal which investigates complaints against the intrusive use of powers.\n\n\n\n  \n\n So 9 things between them, or in fact about 7 and a quarter, as 2 key proposals from both of them overlap, in strikingly similar language.\n   \n\n  \n\n Both call for changes to the ISC. What's noticeable is their chief concern is public perception. Clegg\u00a0 talks about the ISC persuading the public that it is capable of\u00a0 \u201cholding the agencies' feet to the fire\u201d, Cooper's reasoning for an opposition chair is so as not to appear to be \u201can extension of the government\u201d. No, what would help is a chair that can do the job properly. If they both think that Rifkind can't hack it they should have the guts to say so. But there is nothing proposed that will persuade the public that the ISC can make a material difference whoever is in charge. As for making sure the committee is able to draw on technical knowhow, it shows what a disastrous state the whole system is in that basically \u201cperhaps we should know what we are talking about\u201d even needs to be said.\n   \n\n  \n\n Much of the rest is about packaging too. Commissioners, inspectors, or tsars it's all much of a muchness. More interviews, well that's just better PR. A web portal which is not an unreasonable idea, does risk being a propaganda channel, particularly if you call it surveillance.gov.uk . I doubt that it would include in Optic Nerve FAQs: \u201cCan you see my knackers/minge? Probably, yes.\u201d\n   \n\n  \n\n The idea of the right of appeal on\u00a0 Investigatory Powers Tribunal decisions is good, but is pretty meaningless in practice without reforming the legal framework which we so constantly have been told is being rigidly adhered to.\n   \n\n  \n\n This just leaves 2 ideas between the 2 of them that might actually lead to something being done about mass surveillance rather than responding to or spinning what has taken place.\n   \n\n  \n\n Clegg announced an \u201cexpert panel\u201d to look at the principles that govern the use of surveillance and \u201cwhere necessary\u201d recommend new legislation. This is to be under the wing of the defence thinktank Royal United Services Institute, which proudly displays endorsements from General Petraeus and Tony Blair on its website. Still, the move itself is positive in as far as the chief concern we have had has always been about the principles driving forward programmes like PRISM. But the reality is, as the DPM admits, his panel does not have broad political backing and will not be able to do anything before the next general election at the earliest.\n   \n\n  \n\n Just one of the proposals, Cooper's call to revisit RIPA holds of any kind of real hope of actual helpful results. We have been calling for concrete measures to revise RIPA since 2012. But again, Cooper holds out no specifics as to how this review will be carried out or by who.\n   \n\n  \n\n Crucially, neither Clegg nor Cooper set out the direction of travel they would like to see for the RUSI panel or the RIPA review. For all the rhetoric about protecting democracy and individuals, they simply will not commit to dismantling the surveillance state that has been proliferating under both of their watches. Cooper fails to acknowledge that RIPA and so much of what has happened is the poisonous legacy of the Blair era. Equally, Clegg neatly avoids dealing with the promises he made with the end of the Snoopers' Charter. Specifically, what capabilities over and above PRISM, TEMPORA and 'Mastering the Internet' did he and his advisers anticipate being unleashed by the Communications Data Bill? And given the visits he talks about making to the intelligence agencies was he aware of these capabilities before the Guardian reports?\n   \n\n  \n\n Put simply Labour and the LibDems want to shuffle chairs and keep up appearances. We want an end to mass surveillance. There must be a concrete commitment to comb through and change all of the terror legislation which has opened up the door to this unprecedented intrusion. Any surveillance has to be specific to individuals and under court order. The principles of proportionality need reaffirming. There must be new balances strengthening data protection, the right to encryption and practically enshrining privacy rights. There must be an open enquiry in to the very capabilities themselves, how they relate to any legal frameworks and how they were sanctioned. We must stop stalling on data protection on the European level. Protection for whistleblowers must be set out. We should offer Edward Snowden asylum, perhaps now more than ever given the situation with Russia.\n   \n\n  \n\n Clegg opened his speech saying \u201cit is vital... we work tirelessly and unremittingly to sustain and support public trust in the security services and secure widespread political consent for their activities and reach.\u201d Indeed. But I'm clear Mr Clegg, they do not have my trust. They do not have my consent. I don't see this as a radical position. I see this as a logical position knowing what we know now. That can not change until real action is taken in parliament to protect our liberties.\n   \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["Leader", "Loz Kaye", "Surveillance", "Clegg", "Snowden"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/party-magazine/libdems-and-labour-%E2%80%93-nothing-offer-mass-surveillance", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150416190713/http://pirateparty.org.uk/party-magazine/libdems-and-labour-%E2%80%93-nothing-offer-mass-surveillance"}, "/blog/george-walkden/prospective-eu-candidate-george-walkden": {"state": "full", "title": "Prospective EU Candidate: George Walkden", "body": "\n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20150322224541im_/http://pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/George.jpg?itok=IrvIVK84)\n I'm a lecturer and researcher in linguistics at the University of Manchester, where I've been working since receiving my PhD in 2012.

Putting military metaphors aside, what struck home was that any mass movement needs more than volunteers and enthusiasm to succeed. It also needs organization and resources. In fact, it needs the right organization and the right resources. In the film, Guevara is presented as more than just a passionate idealist. He is also a talented organizer. In one scene, Guevara berates a junior officer for not scheduling the relief for a watch, hence leaving two soldiers on guard all night long. In another scene, Guevara interviews a new recruit, and having judged how to use her talents, he gives her the important job of making collections from nearby farmers. Several times in the movie, we see Guevara talking to his troops about the importance of learning to read and write, so they have the skills they need to tell fact from fiction and can learn to do more than shooting guns and carrying equipment. We can be thankful we still live in a democratic society, and that our struggle will be fought with words and not bullets. Even so, we need the same approach of being disciplined and organized, because we face hostility and entrenched opposition to our goals.\n \n\n\n\n\n Our opponents will not give in easily. They are organized and they have tremendous resources at their disposal. That much is obvious. Just the other day we had the news story of Peter Mandelson dining with David Geffen at the Rothschild's villa in Corfu. We are challenging the interests of people with enormous wealth and power. They will not allow their wealth and power to be diminished without a tenacious fight. To defeat them, we pirates need to be as organized as Guevara's guerrillas. That means recognizing where we have jobs that need doing, even if they are not glamorous. It also means recognizing where we have gaps in the skills we need, and doing something to close those gaps.\n \n\n\n\n To begin with, we need to identify supporters that have crucial skills and are willing to help us do specialist jobs for the party. To do this, we intend to set up \u2018expert\u2019 groups within the party. Each group will be a pool of volunteers with special qualifications or experience that the party needs. Membership of a group will be limited to individuals with relevant qualifications. To help set up the groups, I am initially looking for a coordinator for each group. If you have the relevant background, and would like to volunteer to be coordinator for one of the groups, please contact me. The expert groups we are looking to form are:\n \n\n\n1. A Lawyers\u2019 Expert Group to assist with legal obligations of running the party and interpreting legal implications of proposed reforms;\n2. An Accountants\u2019 Expert Group to assist with implementation and execution of robust financial controls within the party;\n3. An Economists\u2019 Expert Group to assist with interpreting economic implications of proposed reforms; and\n4. A Journalists and Media Expert Group to assist with presenting the party message in a way that is accessible and attractive to the media.\n\n\n\n If you are willing to volunteer to coordinate and recruit members to one of these groups, please let me know.

It\u2019s true that the initial choice to take any drug is personal choice but there are many factors even behind that choice: 2/3 of heroin users take recourse to it because they are trying to forget something terrible from their past (e.g. physical or sexual abuse). If you ask, however, the vast majority of addicts now if they chose to be addicted, the answer you will get is a resounding NO. Of course there is a very small percentage who have serious mental health issues and either do not understand they're addicts or refuse to admit they are, which is why mental health and medicinal support are key to solving this problem.\n\n \n\nCurrently the UK Government's policy is to be 'at war' with drugs adopting a stance of criminalising anyone who is caught in possession of drugs. This is based on some utopian idea that this will 'scare' people from taking drugs, but it clearly doesn't work.  All over the world it is becoming more and more clear that to criminalise addiction itself - which is what the war on drugs does - is simply ineffective in dealing with the problem. It costs billions in tax payers' money for wasted police time, as well as drained NHS resources, attempting to deal with the dreadful effects the drugs have on people\u2019s health. The stigma associated with drug addiction and its criminalisation are just pushing those most in need of help further and further away from society; a criminal record for drugs will stop anyone from getting all but the most menial of jobs, preventing any kind of real social rehabilitation. This keeps addicts stuck in a vicious cycle where ironically ruthless criminal gangs appear to the addicts as the only ones offering any help. This puts addicts under the control of shadowy gangsters, who by milking those unfortunate to be addicts make a fortune (estimated to be close to \u00a37 billion), thus corrupting our society and, in the worst cases, even the police.\n\n \n\n So, what is the answer?\n\n \n\n An increasing number of countries are moving away from criminalising addiction and focus on actually helping those caught up in the cycle of addiction. Portugal is a shining example of the right approach: it decriminalised drug possession and started offering drugs to addicts under controlled medical settings. This had a number of positive side-effects: addicts were getting controlled doses of \"clean\" safe substances thus minimising deaths from overdosing and contaminated drugs; drug dealers no longer had control on the market and their profits moved from the black market to Government coffers thus saving taxpayers' money and even financing more medical and mental health services; and of course fewer people now decide to follow a \"career\" of drug dealing as there is no money or glory in it. It just makes sense. \n\n \n\n Just like Portugal, the UK needs to shift focus from criminalisation to harm reduction:  instead of tying up police and court time and wasting the associated tax money on 'dealing' with those caught with small amounts of drugs for personal use, we should be directing them to health professionals to get help with the underlying problems they have (physical or mental health issues, or both as in most cases). This will free up police and court time to tackle the dealers instead.\n\n \n\nJust like in Portugal, we should provide safe places for drug addicts who need to inject, with clean sterile equipment under the supervision of health professionals. We should also provide, as a matter of course, prescription drugs to replace the ones found on the streets, such as diamorphine. Abusing both legal and illegal drugs  is a health issue and it should be treated as such. Drug abusers should be provided with care, advice and assistance to reduce or even prevent dependency, as well as support to ensure that they can soon operate effectively within society. For these reasons, and because the NHS largely deals with the negative consequences of substance abuse, it would make sense for the NHS to take the lead in both research and providing advice in all areas of drug policy, from the medicinal use of marijuana to the impact and dangers of new recreational drugs.\n\n \n\nUK Legislation for substance abuse is also archaic. Currently there is a herbal antidote to the effects of Spice, called THCV, made in the cannabis plant alongside d9THC and many other cannabinoids. It has recently been shown to have antagonist actions against the psychosis produced by d9THC and thus would almost certainly attenuate spice intoxication. Sadly, just a few months ago, the Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs refused to make it available for this purpose on the spurious grounds that a note from 1974 said that when given intravenously in high doses it acted similarly to d9THC in a way.\n\n \n\n The latest Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 is quite possibly one of the worst pieces of legislation I have seen in my lifetime.  The main effect of it was to close down all the \"head shops\" that were selling legal highs, which pushed the problem onto the streets rather than doing something positive. It also has the effect of basically criminalising any new substances until they are 'deemed' safe, effectively stopping any research into the effects of new substances, again further pushing them onto the streets.\n\n \n\nSpeaking to the most affected group of people in our society, the homeless, has shown me how dreadful the effect of Spice has become: I am told that people are so desperate to get their hands on the drug that they are robbing each other both of money and the drugs themselves, doing anything they can to get hold of more. At the same time, dealers are simply handing it out like candy knowing full well how addictive it is, securing new custom. In Manchester Piccadilly Gardens you can see the dealers all hanging about, while the addicts battle over the money and the drugs in plain sight. Police cuts have also put a massive strain on the police force, when this problem should, in fact, be dealt with through a change in legislation to regulate these chemicals and allow health professionals to deal with the root causes. \n\n \n\n We desperately need to update our laws surrounding substance abuse, as the archaic legislation behind many of the Government policies simply does not keep up with the influx of new and \"improved\" (more powerful) substances and, as such, addiction will continue to blight the lives of many of the most excluded people from ever having a chance to get back into society.\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": [], "source": [], "url": "https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/neil-blackburn/addiction-and-harm-reduction", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614125742/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/neil-blackburn/addiction-and-harm-reduction", "date": "2017-06-05T12:53:43+01:00"}, "/blogs/morgan-hill/speech-i-was-going-use-cancelled-hustings": {"state": "full", "title": "A speech I was going to use at a cancelled hustings", "body": "\n\n\n\n Sorry to disappoint you. As you can see, I\u2019m an ordinary young man in ordinary clothes. You see the Pirate Party. It isn\u2019t a joke party and I\u2019m not a joke candidate, it is part of a substantial political movement. The pirate movement, supported by many around the world, aims for: open democracy, patent/copyright reform and the protection of privacy. Our sister party in Iceland has 10 seats in their parliament.\n \n\n\n\n I take the pirate movements principals to mean simply the following: \u201cProviding people with clear rights.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n Governments are made of people, they\u2019re not magic, so they should operate in a manner that\u2019s accessible to people. If a government is not accessible to people, then people cannot give informed consent to the government, a government that does not have informed consent is worse than no government at all.\n \n\n\n\n Today we are subjected to the politics of fear. Fear deceives you of rationality and provokes instantaneous consent to reactionary policies that you\u2019ll soon regret.\n \n\n\n\n The NHS is struggling to cope with more patients and less health care professionals; we expect our intelligence agencies to utilise more data, in an addition to the existing volume that they struggle to process. Simply increasing the amount of data our intelligence agencies can access, is like increasing the number of patients a doctor must see, the overall quality goes down. Mass surveillance is ineffective security. You don\u2019t even have to take my word for it ask William Bonney or Edward Snowden.\n \n\n\n\n Moving on to local issues. what we must remember is that there isn\u2019t one election happening on Thursday there are five hundred and fifty-three individual constituency elections, so you must vote based on who will represent you no party leader personalities. If elected I will stand up for Eddisbury in a way that the candidates from other parties simply can\u2019t. You see the Pirate Party has no whip system, meaning I can always cote in the interests of the constituency, there is no pressure for me to compromise constituency values for national agendas or personal benifit.\n \n\n\n\n Our local authorities need more funding, to improve our waste management infrastructure and create green transport options like safe cycle routes for commuting and leisure. Our disposable society needs to be targeted with multiple angles, first improving the way we recycle waste, secondly by putting pressure on manufactures to rethink packaging and built in obsolescence. Increasing cycling will have enumerable benefits making our society healthier, improving our air quality and reducing the strain on our roads.\n \n\n\n\n As technology increases its grip on our lives it\u2019s worth considering the social, moral and security impacts. The current election campaign is a prime example of the use of your personal information, by major parties aided by the emergent sector of surveillance capitalism, to target advertisement and messaging. Information you have handed other in exchange for services that are perceived to be a necessity is being used to alter not only your purchasing habits but the views you hold. While the specifying of targets is still a human task, it is a set of computer algorithms that decide whether you fit the target market, do you deserve an explanation of why you are seeing an advertisement.\n \n\n\n\n While Brexit is now something I\u2019m resigned to, it would be irresponsible to write off all the rights we have accumulated while in the European Union, we should be wearying of slipping further into Americas back pocket. We must negotiate trade deals that do not allow the free flow of personal information to other territories with weak privacy protections that leave it subject to foreign government and corporate surveillance. The Safe harbour agreement which summed up many of the data protection issues I fear from future Anglo-American trade deals, was invalidated by the European Court of Justice [in Luxembourg], on the basis that it conflicts with the essence of your rights.\n \n\n\n\n One of the most pressing issues the UK has is gross income inequality; the UK has the fourth largest income inequality in Europe and the seventh largest in so called \u201cdeveloped countries\u201d according to data from the Luxembourg Income Study. Inequality is extremely visible in the housing market, as developers oversupply three and four bed family homes at the expense of starter homes, making starter home are expensive but once established it is relatively easy to upscale. Developers must be incentivised to build starter homes, this may mean regulating that developers must build 1 or more starter homes for each family home they produce, this regulation would best take place in local government.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["Morgan Hill", "GE2017", "Eddisbury"], "source": [], "url": "https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/morgan-hill/speech-i-was-going-use-cancelled-hustings", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170609224228/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/morgan-hill/speech-i-was-going-use-cancelled-hustings", "date": "2017-06-07T20:03:47+01:00"}, "/blogs/david-elston/government-and-main-parties-point-finger-social-media-terrorist-attack": {"state": "full", "title": "Government and Main Parties Point the Finger at Social Media for Terrorist Attack", "body": "\n\n\n\n While Manchester still grieves, there are those who have already started using the event to further their own political agenda.\n \n\n\n\n As soon as the election is over, the government will seek to immediately pass new powers allowing the police and MI5 to remove all encryption from services such as WhatsApp and Facebook, despite social media providers' stringent opposition to any action weakening encryption. Further to this, non-partisan professionals such as Open Rights Group (ORG) have also continually raised their opposition to providing a back door to encryption, since it entirely destroys the concept of security.\n \n\n\n\n Despite both campaigners and business professionals warning against it, the government is locked on this dangerous course.\n \n\n\n\n We will continue making the case that by providing an easy way around encryption, you make the service far less secure and put the public at risk. Encryption saves lives. It keeps our bank information and our location, or typical locations, secure. It protects who we talk to - friends, parents, and our children. It provides a safe way to communicate after and during an attack like the ones we saw in Manchester and earlier this year, in Westminster.\n \n\n\n\n No degree of shredding encryption will make us safer. Encryption, by design, makes sure that only those that we intend to see our most sensitive of conversations and data are able to access that information.

The level of threat clearly proves there is no more time to waste now.\n \n\n\n\n \u201cThe social media companies have been laughing in our faces for too long.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n As expected but still no less disheartening, both the Conservatives and Labour appear united in destroying our private lives and putting us at greater risk either through ignorance or dispassion. Conservative Candidate Tom Tugendhat, along with Former Labour Cabinet Minister Baroness Jowell, have already expressed that they are singling out social media as a main component of the terrorist attack.\n \n\n\n\n Of course precautions must be made when a threat is clear, but it would be far more effective to have a more focused intelligence agency perform targeted surveillance on the basis of warnings such as the ones provided by the family of the perpetrator in Manchester prior to the bombing. Sweeping mass surveillance and breaking encryption has little to offer by comparison, and wastes valuable resources that could be invested into dealing with known or genuinely suspected threats.\n \n\n\n\n To anyone who understands Digital, we know that by taking this approach to countering terrorism, with the vast amounts of data that are trawled up, it is akin to taking a shot in the dark and hoping for a hole in one.\n \n\n\n\n By giving up our private lives and allowing the threat of terrorism to limit our personal freedoms, we are announcing defeat. Our communities should be coming together in the wake of such a serious tragedy, and politicians should not be playing games with people's emotions around such atrocities. Terrorists seek to disrupt our normal way of life, and as a nation that prides itself on freedom and acceptance, we give in to their tactics by cracking down on our own liberties.\n \n\n\n\n This is why, in the face of adversity, we must stand together and not lose sight of what matters most.\n \n\n\n\n ---\n   \n\n Like Dave on\n [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thypiratedave/) \n  \n\n Follow Dave on\n [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ThyPirateDave) \n  \n\n Chat to us on\n [Discord](/) \n\n\n\n\n Read a detailed article about\n [\"Why Responding to Terrorism with Curtailed Digital Freedom is Wrong\"](/party-magazine/why-responding-terrorism-curtailed-digital-freedom-wrong) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["David A Elston", "Deputy Leader", "Acting Leader", "Leaders Update", "Manchester attack", "Terrorism", "Terrorist Attack", "Mass Surveillance", "encryption"], "source": [], "url": "https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/david-elston/government-and-main-parties-point-finger-social-media-terrorist-attack", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614125742/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/david-elston/government-and-main-parties-point-finger-social-media-terrorist-attack", "date": "2017-05-25T11:56:32+01:00"}, "/blogs/adrian-farrel/importance-positive-campaign": {"state": "full", "title": "The Importance of a Positive Campaign", "body": "\n\n\n\n We have grown familiar with political campaigning in our country, and this General Election is bringing out more of the same. The focus is on the harm other parties might do, on the characters and capabilities of the opposing candidates, and on the flaws in the policies and manifestos that others are putting forward.\n \n\n\n\n In short, the campaigns that are being run are largely negative. It's easy to see how we all get sucked into this way of talking. It is much simpler to put out a Tweet with a comical picture of a party leader and a witty comment than it is to think through your own beliefs and policies. And when you're immersed in a social media world that is swamped with similar conversations it is only natural to respond in kind turning political debate into a tribal battle.\n \n\n\n\n But wouldn't it be nice if the campaign could stay positive? If we spoke up about what we want to see happen, what policies we support, and why? If we focused on what we have to offer rather than what we hate about the opposition?\n \n\n\n\n Sometimes you will find that other parties have policies you can support and agree with. That shouldn't be a cause for upset or hand-wringing. In fact, it should give rise to celebration \u2013 policies that you think are important have been adopted, and what you want is to see those policies implemented.\n \n\n\n\n So I would like to encourage all of the Pirate Party UK candidates to run a positive campaign. To talk about the core Pirate Party principles, to emphasise the policies that they support, and to listen to the desires and aspirations of the voters in the constituencies where they are standing.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["GE2017", "General Election 2017", "Campaign", "Adrian Farrel"], "source": [], "url": "https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/adrian-farrel/importance-positive-campaign", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614125735/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/adrian-farrel/importance-positive-campaign", "date": "2017-05-12T10:53:51+01:00"}, "/blogs/gsykes/leaked-document-reveals-secret-government-plan-disrupt-encryption": {"state": "full", "title": "Leaked document reveals secret government plan to disrupt encryption", "body": "\n\n\n\n On May 4th, 2017, the Open Rights group released a document detailing government plans to install backdoors enabling them to intercept\u00a0real-time\u00a0communications\u00a0of\u00a0up to 10,000 people.\n \n\n\n\n By doing so Amber Rudd\u2019s plan to ban end to end encryption will come to reality.\u00a0This will not only force any company with more than 10,000 users to let government organisations view in real time the communications of any of their users, but by doing so will enable any hacker in the world with the codes to access the \"hand-over point\", but it gets worse.

It has fielded a few candidates in European and National elections, but like most small parties it is significantly constrained by the UK electoral system. Despite this, the Pirate Party has started to poll alongside major parties and is looking to build support from the grassroots. The party will be standing candidates in the June 2017 General Election.\n \n\n\n\n Find out more about the UK Pirate Party at\n <https://pirateparty.org.uk/>\n or contact\n [campaigns@pirateparty.org.uk](mailto:campaigns@pirateparty.org.uk) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["encryption", "backdoor", "Privacy"], "source": [], "url": "https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/gsykes/leaked-document-reveals-secret-government-plan-disrupt-encryption", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614125742/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/gsykes/leaked-document-reveals-secret-government-plan-disrupt-encryption", "date": "2017-05-05T22:19:44+01:00"}, "/blogs/adrian-farrel/why-its-important-make-small-donation-small-party": {"state": "full", "title": "Why It's Important to Make a Small Donation to a Small Party", "body": "\n\n\n\n Our electoral system is skewed against small political parties \u2013 it's well known.\n \n\n\n\n Perhaps the most obvious problem is the \"first past the post\" system of single constituency MPs elected to represent large areas by the largest number of votes but without a requirement for a majority. Thus, most of our representatives in Parliament got the largest number of votes in their constituencies, but do not have the support of the majority of the voters.\n \n\n\n\n This translates to a Government that is hugely unrepresentative of the people. So-called \"minor parties\" in British politics can gather a significant proportion of national vote, but never be the largest party in any one constituency and never get any representatives in the House of Commons.\n \n\n\n\n While there are many benefits to democracy from our system (stability, direct representation), the drawbacks lead to a feeling of distance and disenfranchisement. The incumbent major parties see no benefit to themselves in a change in the system and there is a consequent disillusionment and Sinicism among voters.\n \n\n\n\n All of these considerations form the background to organisations like Make Votes Count (\n <http://makevotescount.co.uk/>\n ) that is doing research and proposing changes to our electoral system.\n \n\n\n\n**Funding Challenge** \n\n\n\n\n Funding of political parties is achieved through two mechanisms. The first and most notorious is large donations \u2013 some parties get individual contributions that massively exceed the average annual salary as wealthy donors seek to support the party that will most benefit their own interests. The other source of income is from the regular members in the form of fees or donations - the larger parties have, of course, larger memberships and that translates to more capital.\n \n\n\n\n A political party spends its money promoting itself: it may have paid staff, advertising campaigns, web sites, mail-shots. When it comes to election time the funds are stretched in an all-or-nothing attempt to persuade the electorate and attract votes. In national (but not local) elections there is also the \u00a3500 cost of the \"deposit\" that is intended to stop facetious candidates from standing, but that is returned if the candidate gains 5% or more of the vote in the constituency.\n \n\n\n\n The cost of putting up candidates for an election is a significant barrier to minor parties getting involved in our political system. Even at a local level, a candidate can expect to spend a few hundred pounds producing, printing, and distributing leaflets. At national elections this cost goes up with the size of the constituency and is exacerbated by the cost of the deposit since a new party might reasonably expect to not get a huge vote the first time it puts up candidates.\n \n\n\n\n Some parties, such as the Pirate Part UK, think that it is very important that membership fees be kept as low as possible. It is desirable that everyone should be able to participate in politics regardless of their means, and that requires that the cost of joining the party should be very small. But, of course, that means that the party's funds are correspondingly small, and without the economies of scale that are available to a large party, that means that Pirate Party UK barely covers its day-to-day running costs even though it relies heavily on volunteers.\n \n\n\n\n Hence, small parties like the Pirate Party rely heavily on donations to support candidates in elections. When, as is the case now, a \"snap\" election is called there is no time for careful long-term planning and fund raising. So the party is appealing urgently for all donations large or small \u2013 every little counts.\n \n\n\n\n Minor parties and independent candidates play a crucial role in our democracy. They allow other views and perspectives to be discussed; they bring new voices to the debate; and they open space for the disenfranchised and neglected to be heard. This, in turn, can influence and steer the bigger parties.\n \n\n\n\n Help build and launch the Pirate Party ship by donating at\n [https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/lets-build-ship-together](/lets-build-ship-together) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["Donate", "General Election", "GE2017", "Adrian Farrel"], "source": [], "url": "https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/adrian-farrel/why-its-important-make-small-donation-small-party", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614125735/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/adrian-farrel/why-its-important-make-small-donation-small-party", "date": "2017-04-29T05:09:29+01:00"}, "/blogs/adrian-farrel/vote-your-principles-wasted-vote": {"state": "full", "title": "Is a Vote for Your Principles a Wasted Vote?", "body": "\n\n\n\n The media are full of proposals for electoral pacts and ideas for tactical voting. These suggestions are based around keeping one party or another out of government, or making sure that a particular person is not returned to Westminster.\n \n\n\n\n But where does this leave a minority party? Should it encourage its supporters to vote for candidates from other parties and maybe for different parties in different constituencies?\n \n\n\n\n And what should voters do in our first past the post system where their first choice from one of the smaller parties is unlikely to get elected? Should they vote for the person they support or should they consider that a wasted vote?\n \n\n\n\n I am personally very frustrated and disappointed by negative voting. At the previous election my MP said to me words equivalent to, \"Vote for me because at least I'm not one of them.\" This is not exactly a resounding reason to do anything.\n \n\n\n\n What does it mean if a person is elected to parliament? What will they do once they get there? How will they act? What policies will they execute? You can be pretty certain that they will follow their party manifesto more or less. Will they be concerned for what you want or care about? Yes, but only within the constraints of the manifesto promises. So if you vote for a party or a person and they get in, you must expect to get what you voted for.\n \n\n\n\n But shouldn't I vote for the person most likely to get in who is closest to what I want? At least that way the person I really don't want will be kept out? That could work. And obviously it is the solution if you find yourself closely aligned with one candidate's policies. They might not be a perfect fit, but if they are close enough then that is exactly the right thing to do.\n \n\n\n\n And if the candidate that has the policies I most identify with is unlikely to get elected, what should I do? Wouldn't a vote for such a candidate be a wasted vote? Doesn't voting for that candidate risk letting in the wrong person and getting a far worse result?\n \n\n\n\n That all depends on what you want to achieve with your vote. If you want to make a clear statement about what you want and what you care about, then this is your only way to achieve it. You can't just write a letter to a candidate saying you care about one set of policies, but you're voting for them and their different policies and will they please remember that if they get elected: once elected they are going to abide by the policies they stood on.\n \n\n\n\n So it's a long haul for small parties and their supporters. If a candidate from one of the main parties doesn't win by a small margin and if the votes that went to a minor party could have made the difference, then perhaps that candidate will rethink their policies next time. And if the fight is close, perhaps the candidate will even soften their election promises on the fly.\n \n\n\n\n Furthermore, a party that gets a small but respectable vote this time around can use that as a foundation on which to build a larger and more meaningful showing at the next election, and so your vote this time can help to establish the principles you support and build the party that promotes them.\n \n\n\n\n Perhaps the best example of how this works can be seen in the results of the US Presidential election of 2000. Nader, standing as what passed as a Green candidate took just enough votes that George W Bush was able to defeat Al Gore. Notably, in Florida Bush defeated Gore by just 537 votes and Nader polled over 97,000 votes, and it has been rightly observed that had Nader's supporters voted for Gore, the World would have been very different. But who is to blame here? Was it the voters who chose to back the person who had spoken up for what they cared about, or was it Al Gore who didn't move enough to embrace the aspirations and concerns of the electorate? Gore, who had built a reputation for caring about the environment, didn't do enough to convince Nader's supporters \u2013 had he taken a more care and shown more respect for their views he could have become President.\n \n\n\n\n But as a supporter of the Pirate Party I suppose I would say all this, wouldn't I?

First is the political system: unlike our House of Commons, the Icelandic parliament (\n *Al\u00feing* \n ) is elected via\n [party-list proportional representation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Iceland) \n , meaning that it's much easier for smaller parties to gain a voice. Second is the size of the population: at a mere\n [329,100](http://www.statice.is/Statistics/Population/Overview) \n , the whole country has substantially fewer inhabitants than the city of Manchester alone (\n [514,417](http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc134_a/index.html) \n ). In the historic 2013 election that propelled them into parliament, the Icelandic Pirates obtained 9,647 votes - not so many more than the\n [8,597](http://www.northwestvotes.gov.uk/nwv/info/11/results) \n the UK Pirates received when standing in the 2014 European Parliament election, though a much higher proportion of the votes cast (5.1% as opposed to 0.5%). Any comparison between the two parties is going to be tricky.\n \n\n\n\n Still, that's not to say we can't learn from the experiences of our younger but more successful sister. In one respect, we, the Icelandic Pirates, and all other Pirate Parties have a problem in common: growing pains. The ideas and ideals we stand for are popular, as they should be - which means that the movement has to deal with a steady influx of members and supporters. As a result, anything we put in place needs to be scalable, and I think this is the big challenge facing the UK Pirates over the coming years. We've been punching above our weight in the (social and other) media, and able to put forward a positive and progressive vision for UK politics; but when it comes to organizing, we need to move beyond our roots as a group of like-minded activists who contact each other by text and Twitter. Solid internal processes and administration are hardly rock-and-roll, and they're not what any of us signed up for, but they're a necessity if we want the party to grow. That's why my main focus during my brief stint as leader is to try to get the house in order. We need to look inward as well as outward, and sharing expertise that our sister parties have garnered means that we don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n \n\n\n\n Iceland is a country of extremes. On the one hand, it has a language that's changed little in the last thousand years, whose alphabet includes a letter derived from the ancient runic Elder Futhark,\n [\u00de](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(letter)) \n (\n *thorn* \n ). On the other hand, it is at the forefront of the worldwide push for a politics fit for the 21st century.\u00a0Each party in Iceland is represented by a letter of the alphabet on the ballot paper. The Icelandic Pirates were the first party ever to request the letter\n [\u00de](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(letter)) \n (\n *thorn* \n ), which is a great illustration of their combination of tradition and innovation; uncoincidentally, the letter also looks a lot like the Pirate logo. I'm hoping that the Pirates of Iceland will help us to be a thorn in the side of the establishment!\n \n\n\n\n*Photo: George with some of the Pirates of Iceland, enjoying a pizza (essentially Iceland's national dish, much as chicken tikka masala is for the UK).

The road is for the St Athan Enterprise Zone. The statement from Welsh Ministers gave the opinion an Environmental Statement was not required and it did not have to abide by EIA Regulations, despite the road running 1.8km through Green Belt fields and multiple hedgeways.\n \n\n\n\n After our last council meeting I suggested improvements for openness, transparency and general sustainability to the Library's working group for their constitution. Unfortunately they're running on a strict schedule and have to complete transfer by the 31st May 2016.

I briefly had an exchange with Hazel Martin, Head of HR Recruitment for Aston Martin on how to promote their open day and congratulated them on the turn out.\n \n\n\n\n In the mean time, tomorrow I am due to give a talk at Bath University on all things Pirate Party UK and how our first \"Pirate in Power\" is doing.\n   \n\n  \n\n All in all, I'd say we Pirates have had a pretty successful month.

The Lib Dems are a separate party from the Tories and have never had a similar mandate nor have I ever said that they do. We worked as part of a coalition from 2010 to 2015 in the national interest and moderated many extreme Tory policies. We have opposed many of the things they have tried to do since such as cutting benefits for the disabled. I obviously want others to vote for the Lib Dems but as your initial email stated clearly you are not going to do so then I think the assumption in my reply was a fairly safe bet. You have stood for another party before but if you really want to make your vote useful then when it comes to the regional list you should consider voting for me to keep Ukip out.\n   \n\n  \n\n Peter\n   \n\n  \n\n Sent from my Windows Phone\n \n\n\n\n ---\n \n\n\n\n**Final Thoughts** \n\n\n\n\n There you have it, perhaps the Lib Dems new party slogan for the Assembly elections here in Wales should be \"You should consider voting for me to keep UKIP out\".

This innovation would save the NHS vast sums of money; part of that saving will then be used to subsidise drug research.\n   \n\n The pharmaceutical industry currently spends around 15% of its patent drug income on research; we would support that expenditure with subsidies made possible in savings from the NHS. This will increase\u00a0 research budgets, while still saving the NHS money.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n This policy of making all drugs generic will create a massive opportunity for industry to make profits, employ more people and save lives by encouraging the manufacture of newly generic drugs in this country for sale to the third world.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Thirdly Big Pharma like Turing Pharmaceuticals cannot hold the world ransom with hugely unjustifiable medicine costs.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["Big Pharma", "Drug Patents"], "source": [], "url": "http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/david-elston/buying-rights-profit-wrongs", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160409115640/http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/david-elston/buying-rights-profit-wrongs", "date": "2015-09-28T15:22:02+01:00"}, "/blogs/mark-chapman/6-years-back-6-years-forward-wearrsix": {"state": "full", "title": "6 Years Back - 6 Years Forward - #WeArrSix", "body": "\n\n\n\n As the Pirate Party UK celebrates its 6th Birthday this week, it's an opportunity to both look back at what we've achieved as a party, and what we can strive towards over the next 6 years.\n \n\n\n\n In some ways, we've achieved a fair amount simply by still existing - the majority of brand new political parties fold again within the first 5 years. We can be proud too of the many things where we have been at the forefront of campaigning - the Digital Economy Act, DRIPA and the Snoopers Charter, Copyright Reform, Internet Filtering, Democratic Reform and many others.\n \n\n\n\n Over the next 6 years we should be looking to build rapidly on this solid base. We should be focused on building the Pirate name and the Pirate brand across the country and across elections. Having looked at those parties in the UK which have been successful recently (UKIP and the Green Party) what can we hope for in terms of electoral representation over the next 6 years?\n \n\n\n\n Well there are never clean and clear comparisons - when you look at the Green Party do you consider their predecessors (Ecology Party, and before that the short-lived PEOPLE Party)? Equally, when looking at UKIP do you include the performance of James Goldsmith's Referendum Party and the 500 odd seats that they stood in in 1997? Taking the various factors into consideration, I would suggest that we should be aiming for the following (or better!) in 6 years time:\n \n\n\n* Having at least 1 European MEP (2019 Elections)\n* Having at least 1 Member of the London Assembly (2020 Elections)\n* Having at least 1 Member of the Welsh Assembly (2021 Elections)\n* Having at least 1 Member of the Scottish Parliament (2021 Elections)\n* Having multiple elected local councillors\n* Having a large enough profile to be listed as a separate party in Opinion Polls, rather than just included in 'Other'.\n\n\n\n By way of comparison, UKIP achieved their first European MEP 8 years after they were founded - in the Elections that could be considered 'tailor-made' for them.

It's impressive how a man who no one had ever heard of before June 2015 (despite being an MP for thirty years) has been able to generate so much buzz. Yet the reason people like Jeremy Corbyn is simple: he's left-wing. Really left-wing. At a time when the Labour Party is perceived as sliding ever further right, here's someone who promises to buck the trend.\n \n\n\n\n And I can't fault him for that. By\n [most measures](http://www.politicalcompass.org/) \n , I'm pretty damn left-leaning myself. I applaud, for instance, his\n [proposal to scrap university tuition fees](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/15/jeremy-corbyn-announces-10bn-plan-to-scrap-university-tuition-fees) \n . Such a measure would be likely to\n [reduce income inequality](/blogs/george-walkden/pirate-reads-piketty-part-1-knowledge-and-equality) \n ; moreover, tuition fees are\n [regarded as a failed experiment](http://www.independent.co.uk/student/last-german-state-abolishes-university-fees-9774555.html) \n by Germany's current right-leaning government, and feelessness has hardly led to economic disaster in Scandinavia.\n \n\n\n\n For all that I agree with many of Corbyn's policy suggestions, though, in one respect the man is a continuity candidate: his politics come straight from ideology rather than evidence.\n \n\n\n\n The obvious example is his\n [support for homeopathy](https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/10038528258) \n , on which he\n [signed a motion](http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2009-10/908) \n in 2010. In his tweet from that time he states that it \"works for some ppl\" - apparently placing anecdotal self-report above\n [the scientific consensus](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/cam02a_information_paper.pdf) \n . Moreover, his rationale - that \"they both come from organic matter\" - is ridiculous (so does\n [shit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces) \n ).\u00a0In economic policy, too, Corbyn has frequently voiced his opposition to austerity, but much more rarely taken the time to set out what's led him to that conclusion. My own impression is that the economic consensus is that austerity is a misconceived response to an economic slump - but that is a case that needs to be made, not a truth that speaks for itself.\n \n\n\n\n Of course there's an irreducible ideological core to politics (for instance, don't ask me\n *why* \n I think that evidence-based policy is a good thing!). But economic and health issues must not be part of that core. To allow otherwise is to allow the debate to be framed in the same dreary terms that we're used to, with \"persuasive\" and \"charismatic\" politicians dominating the stage rather than ones who've taken the time to assess the issues. Corbyn is often described by supporters as\n [uncompromising](http://labourlist.org/2015/07/corbyn-is-not-standing-for-himself-but-for-the-millions-who-need-a-voice/) \n and\n [consistent](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/19/ghosts-of-labour-party-past-and-hope-for-its-future) \n . These should not be taken as virtues in a politician. What matters far more is the willingness to weigh the evidence and, if the case is made, to change one's mind. Consistency is for football supporters and religious fundamentalists. In and of itself, it has no place in the politics of the twenty-first century.\n \n\n\n\n I'm not going to recommend a candidate in the Labour leadership contest, which seems like a pretty dismal affair to me. Pirates won't be able to vote in that election anyway, since members of political parties who stand candidates against Labour are\n [not allowed to be Labour members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party_membership_in_the_United_Kingdom) \n (the Pirate Party has no such restriction). But if you're after evidence-based policy, then Corbyn lookalike Obi-Wan Kenobi probably put it best: these aren't the droids you're looking for.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": [], "source": [], "url": "http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/george-walkden/opinion-jeremy-corbyn-not-leader-opposition-needs", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160409114850/http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/george-walkden/opinion-jeremy-corbyn-not-leader-opposition-needs", "date": "2015-07-22T14:27:22+01:00"}, "/blogs/loz-kaye/ttip-news-%E2%80%93-good-bad-and-ugly": {"state": "full", "title": "TTIP News \u2013 Good, Bad and Ugly", "body": "\n\n\n\n During the election one of the top issues in terms of voter emails I received was\n [TTIP](https://pirateparty.org.uk/campaigns/issues/ttip-trading-away-our-rights) \n , and the dangers it poses to public health, labour protection, the environment, digital rights and the very way our democracy operates.

This vote not to vote was something of an anticlimax after the series of reports on the EU-US trade agreement, which was supposed to lead to a negotiating position that the European Parliament could get behind.\n \n\n\n\n The good news is that clearly an agreement which harms our rights, our hard won protections and our democracy is unacceptable to most MEPs, and there was not a prospect of getting through a report which didn't reflect that view. Over the weeks more and more voices and objections have been raised. MEPs like Jude Kirton-Darling have been very vocal in their opposition to ISDS, and determined to protect public services. The report explicitly mentions ACTA and that there can be no repeat of what has already been rejected. Issues like ensuring our environmental, animal welfare and public health protection are addressed. This is all good news, that arguments are being won, even if the battle is ongoing.\n \n\n\n\n It seems particularly perverse to me that some campaigners have not been able to acknowledge this. MEPs like Kirton-Darling have received much abuse when we need them most. It's all too easy to get fixated on one fight.\n \n\n\n\n This has lead to oversimplification of the issues and some fundamental misunderstandings. Many people seem to have been under the impression the vote on June 10\n th \n was to have been \u201con TTIP\u201d either rejecting or accepting it. That is not the stage we are at when the vote does come. The European Parliament does bear a deal of responsibility for the confusion. For all the many languages spoken there, it seems unable to communicate in a way that anyone can really be expected to understand. But all the calls of \u201cjust days to stop TTIP\u201d haven't helped either, however much I realise raising the stakes does get attention.\n \n\n\n\n What the Parliament will be voting on is what they want to see in the deal, and what they want excluded. This is not a guarantee that any of that will happen, given the behind closed doors dealing. So this is the bad news. Postponing the vote doesn't mean postponing TTIP. It means that the negotiators can continue without having to listen to European citizens' views. And sending the report back to committee may well be a way to exclude listening to our views.\n \n\n\n\n The experience of ACTA clearly has left its mark. So it should have come as no surprise to the Commission and the Parliament that so many of us have stood up. The vote postponement leaves a very bad taste, just at the point the UK is deciding what its future relationship should be to the EU. And still the main problem remains. Deals that are supposed to be about benefiting all of us need to done in the open, transparently. Until then, these battles will continue.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": [], "source": [], "url": "http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/loz-kaye/ttip-news-%E2%80%93-good-bad-and-ugly", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160409203833/http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/loz-kaye/ttip-news-%E2%80%93-good-bad-and-ugly", "date": "2015-06-10T23:30:05+01:00"}, "/blogs/phil-cooke/simplicityweve-heard-it": {"state": "full", "title": "Simplicity....we've heard of it", "body": "\n\n\n\n Over the past days, you've probably noticed a bit of a theme in some of the blogs people have been putting up (like this one).

We need volunteers to be able to carry out our work. However, when we get queries about volunteering (which can arrive by several different methods, it's difficult to contact the right person/department or to get them the tools/resources for the jobs we need performed. Our internal systems are complex (a by-product I feel of the type of member we initially attracted*) and our processes for handling requests and putting out material are complex due to this.\n \n\n\n\n So, here is a simple message for anyone planning to stand for the NEC or Board vacancies later this month from someone who has volunteered on both:\n \n\n\n\n Don't be afraid to tear up or rip out the things which are not working. We have 4 years until the next big set of elections, use them wisely to build on what is working and rethink that which isn't.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n *Disclaimer: I count myself as one of these and am far from blameless in introducing complexity into our processes - please challenge me if you catch me at this in future!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": [], "source": [], "url": "http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/phil-cooke/simplicityweve-heard-it", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160409203724/http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/phil-cooke/simplicityweve-heard-it", "date": "2015-05-15T21:43:54+01:00"}, "/blogs/david-elston/silent-gratitude-isn%E2%80%99t-much-use-anyone": {"state": "full", "title": "Silent gratitude isn\u2019t much use to anyone", "body": "\n\n\n\n I was running through my head the number of people who helped make the\n [Bridgend 106](https://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/david-elston/rise-pirates) \n a reality and thought to myself \u201cI must thank them\u201d. By the time I tallied them all up, a blog post seemed inevitable. So many people worked tirelessly to give Piracy a voice in our democracy.\n   \n\n  \n\n Let's get started!\n   \n\n  \n\n I think it would be pretty bold of me\u00a0 to start a series of Thank-Yous without starting with Loz. As I have said before, you're the first leader of any party who I actually believed and who I could tell actually believed in what he was saying. You never once resigned to the tired old Westminster soundbites and despite everything, delivered you next sentence with a grace and cheer that gives our politics a sense of hope, something the other party leaders should really take note of. I've never seen a leader so approachable, even on the night of the count, you checked in with me down in Bridgend to make sure I, personally, was doing all right.\n   \n\n  \n\n A very deserving thanks is due to all my fellow candidates, Cris, Mark, Sam, Andy and again Loz. The pooling our knowledge, sharing our resources and the weekly candidate meet-ups were hugely influential to my campaign. The victory down here is as much mine as it is yours, I feel I owe you all new keyboard with the word-count you must have clocked, repling to my e-mails, sending me materials and uploading new information to our shared spaces.\n   \n\n  \n\n There were so many activists on twitter, facebook and reddit that all came out in support of our campaign in Bridgend.\n [@danfoxdavies](https://twitter.com/danfoxdavies) \n[@RayJoha2](https://twitter.com/RayJoha2) \n[@hackerfantastic](https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic) \n[@wendycrockcroft](https://twitter.com/wendycrockcroft) \n[@DMSCduck](https://twitter.com/DMSCduck) \n and so many others were instrumental to getting my follower base increased and the message that the Pirate Party has landed in Wales out there. Not forgetting\n [@1BDesign](https://twitter.com/1BDesign) \n who was the first person to announce he would be voting for me here!\n   \n\n  \n\n A particularly old friend of the Pirate Party, especially internationally was Anonymous. I saw many Anons come out in support of our party once again and I look forward to strengthening these ties once more. We had\n [@t0p\\_100](https://twitter.com/t0p_100) \n from AnonUK Radio who pledged on air he would be voting for us where-ever possible.\n [@xugla](https://twitter.com/xugla) \n (aka Kanjin), someone who always calls it how he sees it, also showed deep compassion for many of our objectives.\n [@StlGal\\_38](https://twitter.com/StlGal_38) \n was also never short to show affection for the Pirate cause.\n   \n\n  \n\n I suppose it would also be wrong of me not to thank my fellow candidates down here in Bridgend. Each candidate I spoke with, discussed their and my views with the utmost respect. I was deeply encouraged by the volume of anti-austerity opposition that showed at The Count.\n   \n\n  \n\n There are also many people within the Party, on the Board and in the NEC that deserve much more thanks than I can really express. Much of your work was hidden in the background from me as a candidate and much of it is hard to label, so I'll simply say thank you for keeping the engine room working while those of us above board are fighting.\n   \n\n  \n\n But this is where I get really clich\u00e9 and say my biggest thanks rests with my mostly a-political girlfriend, Rebecca. You think you didn't help at all or that in some way, you felt you were getting in the way. The reality is you showed me tremendous support while going through a huge increase in responsibilities at your work and during your studies, not to mention a horde of other things. You're mostly disinterested in politics but took an interest to help me and words will never show just how important that is to me. You even pirate-themed our Easter!\n   \n\n  \n\n Now don't get nervous. I know we've had a few announcements of Pirates needing some much needed time to step back and reconnect with loved ones and return to their personal lives \u2013 but this Pirate has plenty of fight in him yet.\n   \n\n  \n\n There are so many positives to draw from this election and plenty of criticisms we need to be ready to let hit us, full force, in order to improve. Let us all band together in what is going to be 5 years of hell under this Conservative government. We must find these solutions together.\n   \n\n  \n\n The establishment have made it clear. They want to operate in private and think every innocent person should have absolutely no privacy. We say no! We say this Government is backwards! YOU should act in complete openness and OUR individual privacy should be respected!\n   \n\n  \n\n In short, what I'm saying to you is, let's cause some trouble for those out of touch parties.

The first Pirate Pioneers in the UK did not always poll in triple figures, this time every candidate did... but before we get into that, let's reflect on what happened at The Count on election night for the first Welsh Pirate election, in Bridgend.\n   \n\n  \n\n There is no denying there was always a strong undertone in Bridgend that \u201cIf we don't vote Labour then the Tories will get in\u201d and many Pirate voters originally expressed the same concern to me. While Labour winning in Bridgend is certainly not a victory for us Pirates, it is undeniably better than having a parachuted in Conservative candidate, which is more than many other constituencies in the UK woke up to on the 8th. The incumbent MP also took the time to speak with me as did her son and I have been invited to talk about the Pirate Party at Bath University.\n   \n\n  \n\n The Plaid Cymru Candidate had a really good 2,784 (7.1%) Vote, which is a 1.1% increase. James was also a very likeable person and we shared a laugh over how we both had long hair and unavoidably met the odd person that would always say \u201cI can't vote for him, he needs a haircut\u201d.\n   \n\n  \n\n Rather interestingly, many of the spoilt ballot papers featured a number of cases where two candidates had been marked \u2013 most of which were Pirate Party and Plaid Cymru. I expect this is because in local council, Welsh Assembly and European elections, you mark more than one candidate so the GE is a rather unusual one for us in Wales. James also mentioned that if he wasn't running in Bridgend, he would have voted for me and I think given the choice here and without a Pirate to vote for, perhaps I would have voted for him too. I would like to thank even those who spoilt their vote, be it accidental or intentional, we still saw you liked both Pirates and Plaid Cymru.\n   \n\n  \n\n The Independent, Les and I spoke quite frequently through the night and we had met once before. We seem to have a rather lot of areas we disagree on but as a person it's hard not to like him. With Les being able to connect with people so quickly and genuinely he was able to pull a rather impressive campaign, even beating the Green vote here. I hope we can meet to disagree in the future.\n   \n\n  \n\n UKIP and the Conservatives mostly kept to themselves, including separate from one another. I did make a small, passing conversation with the UKIP candidate and some with her. She was surprised I spoke with her and thanked me for my comments. I always think back to something Rick Falkvinge said; where you must not treat your opposition as evil. These are people you should open a dialogue with and provide them with new information, a new source of knowledge and education. Treating them like \u201cthe other\u201d to be hated will not allow anyone to really re-think their position, it will simply drive their heels in further.\n   \n\n  \n\n Which brings us to the National Front. Around the start of the night we were all in the same area trying to get into where they counted the ballots. The National Front candidate and I ended up essentially staring at one another as they reshuffled us around the floor. I said hello and he mentioned I thought I'd be dressed more like a Pirate. I laughed with \u201cWell, at least you can say you've met a Pirate, even if I don't look like one\u201d and extended my hand to shake his. He was immediately shocked. Perhaps the mere thought of being \u201ccaught\u201d shaking the hand of the National Front would be political suicide for most politicians. He shook my hand, then a NF agent quickly jumped in to shake my hand too. We discussed some of our views that night. While the NF were obviously showing hostility to others there that night, hostility I by no way approve of, when speaking to me they were calm, collective and like us hated the lack of transparency in government. I cannot stress enough how we can completely neutralise a lot of the hate, fear and violence culture by breaking this unsavoury popular stance of hating your opposition. There is exceedingly little, perhaps nothing I like about the National Front but they were there representing a voice of 66 people in Bridgend and in a democracy those voices must be heard. Can we really stand as Pirates, advocating free speech but deny it to those we disagree with?\n   \n\n  \n\n At the end of the night, the Labour MP did the same and shook his hand, in fact she shook every single candidate's hand on stage, in front of everyone. The National Front candidate was again shocked, turned to me and said \u201cThat was a first\u201d.\n   \n\n  \n\n It will be of no surprise that the Lib Dem vote here was hammered, pulling only 5th place. While it must be devastating for them to see, they prove as a valuable lesson as to what happens when you turn your back so quickly on those who put their trust in you... and I think all candidates understood that at the count.\n   \n\n  \n\n The Green vote increased here and the co-chairs of the Bridgend branch both met with me. Bethan (one of the co-chairs) was particularly friendly. They, perhaps a little begrudgingly, admit their candidate was a paper candidate and standing in two positions but rather than leave the count devoid of Greens, four Greens turned up for Bridgend, so at least those votes had some representation on the night.\n   \n\n  \n\n My thoughts on TUSC have already been expressed\n [here](https://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/david-elston/ge2015-betrayal-tusc) \n .\n   \n\n  \n\n To give the huge 106 votes or 0.3% vote share in Bridgend some perspective; there was very little chance of picking up protest votes with such a diverse array of candidates, of which we had a total of 10. Bridgend is also very much a town, not a city, so we are not used to this volume of choice so any candidate is already at a disadvantage. We also fielded no paper leaflets or mailshot in Bridgend, it was entirely a digital and media driven campaign, saving thousands of pounds.\n   \n\n  \n\n I understand those are circumstantial things which will affect votes, so here is a real visual idea of just what those votes mean:\n   \n\n  \n\n In Bridgend\n \n\n\n* We beat the National Front's 66 votes\n* We are already in the same league as TUSC 118 (perhaps beating them if many of those spoilt ballots were filled out correctly)\n* We were only 630 votes behind the Greens, who are now a Major Party\n\n\n\n  \n\n Looking outward:\n \n\n\n* We beat The Whig Party Leader\n\t+ 103 votes (0.2%) Waleed Ghani in Vauxhall\n* We beat both Young People's Party Candidates\n\t+ 72 votes (0.1%) Dr Rohen Kapur aka Henry Northcott in Folkestone and Hythe\n\t+ 80 votes (0.2%) Mark Wadsworth in Epping Forest\n* We beat each of the six Class War candidates in vote share and all but one in vote number\n\t+ 53 votes (0.1%) Lisa McKenzie in Chingford\n\t+ 55 votes (0%) Joe Wilcox in Maidenhead\n\t+ 120 votes (0.2%) Andy Bennetts in Lichfield\n\t+ 78 votes (0.2%) Dave Perkins in Sherwood\n\t+ 96 votes (0.2%) David Peel in Norwich South\n\t+ 65 votes (0.1%) Jon Bigger in Croydon South\n* We beat the second oldest party, Socialist Party GB's attempt in Wales\n\t+ 49 votes (0.1%) Brian Johnson in Swansea West\n* We beat the New Independent Centralists Leader\n\t+ 23 votes (0.1%) Roland Courtenay in Kensington\n* We beat the Socialist Equality Party in vote share\n\t+ 58 votes (0.2%) Katie Rhodes in Glasgow Central\n\t+ 108 votes (0.2%) David O'Sullivan in Holborn & St Pancras\n* We beat the English Democrats attempt in Wales (unsurprisingly)\n\t+ 100 votes (0.2%) Stephen Morris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We also beat a substantial amount of other Independents and parties accross the UK.\n \n\n\n\n I would like to pay tribute to those who spoilt their votes. Some of you expressed your anger and dissatisfaction with the system with simple \"No\" or gave a discriptor. Others expressed your views through humour, drawing rather creative scenes on the ballots. To you all I say do not give up expressing your views until they are heard and you have someone to vote for.\n \n\n\n\n I wish to express my thanks to all activists both inside and outside of the party who helped us candidates in the campaign, both digitally and physically.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n Finally, I thank everyone who voted Pirate in this election. Every single one of your votes has reassured us that you believe the Pirate Party and its candidates are fighting for what you believe is right. You voted for free speech, you voted to protect privacy and you voted for an end to the mass surveillance of innocent people.\n   \n\n  \n\n Most importantly you all voted for the Candidate who you believed best represented you and did not resign to the fear culture the other parties tried to create.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["David A Elston", "GE2015", "Wales", "Bridgend", "Wales Spokesperson"], "source": [], "url": "http://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/david-elston/rise-welsh-pirates", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160521183441/http://pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/david-elston/rise-welsh-pirates", "date": "2015-05-10T03:52:23+01:00"}, "/blogs/david-elston/whypirate": {"state": "full", "title": "#WhyPirate", "body": "\n\n\n\n The answer to\n [#WhyPirate](https://twitter.com//search?q=%23WhyPirate) \n is so obvious to me.\n   \n\n  \n\n We understand politics are local: To the\n [Daily Wales](http://dailywales.net/2015/01/07/pirate-party-wales-we-need-to-become-a-digital-dragon/) \n I explained that in Wales we want to see reform of the Welsh Language act to move to allowing Welsh to flourish instead of being protected and greater devolution to allow Wales to stand on it's own two feet.

Anonymous and Pirates have always featured side by side in the media \u2013 Anonymous with the internet hacktivism and just a touch of trolling and Pirates in the elections. We spoke about how a man \u201cWeev\u201d was sent to prison for showing how poor security was on an apple website \u2013 and instead of being praised for showing the vulnerability for both the public interest and for the company to improve, he was imprisoned.\n   \n\n  \n\n We are international: I wrote to the\n [Pirate Times](http://piratetimes.net/pirates-emerge-in-wales-ready-for-coming-election/) \n about how politics doesn't have to be grey. It can be an exciting new frontier where we embrace the future instead of thinking how best we can legislate in attempt to lock it down and we are branching out into new countries (like me in Wales!)\n   \n\n  \n\n We aren't afraid of breaking tradition: And of course, the inevitable question, why the name \u201cPirate\u201d. Well as the\n [Wales Eye](http://walespolitico.uk/waleseye/small-is-beautiful/) \n reports the Whigs took their name from an insult. They dared for something better and took this label assigned to them as something to champion. Because of this solid and bold conviction they became the Tories biggest enemy.

We are all guilty of wanting to leave the hard work up to someone else\u2026 but so many movements have died because their last generation didn\u2019t stick around to help the next one. If we are to succeed, I know we\u2019ll need every available hand on deck for whatever the government throws at us next, so don\u2019t feel as if you\u2019re going it alone.\n \n\n\n\n Decisions are rarely neat, clear and easy to make. I\u2019d like to be able to say \u201cjust listen to your members\u201d but the members don\u2019t always agree. In times like this, I\u2019d say whatever decision you come to, at least make it an honest one.\n \n\n\n\n Fighting for a free culture is hard work but it can be bloody fun too. I\u2019ve met so many incredibly intelligent people, discussed principles with many different groups, had both humbling and exciting disagreements and comforting agreements. I\u2019ve given talks to university students, entire halls of community representatives and small local hustings groups. Not to mention you might even get your name in the paper.\n \n\n\n\n Of course new leadership should be able to steer the ship in the way they find most fitting without ex-leadership figures haunting the party, but they should also be supported by those having already had to hold the helm steady through a storm or two.\n \n\n\n\n Leadership comes with its own heavy toll, as my partner routinely likes to remind me, I went greyer by the day, sometimes by the hour. Hopefully, my leadership hasn\u2019t made you greyer too.\n \n\n\n\n I really want to wish the party and the next Pirate leadership nothing but the best and rest assured, if you need help, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all make the effort to show up, despite the weather.\n \n\n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20201202182222im_/https://legacy.pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/Thanks.JPG)\n\n\n\n\n If I can pass on one final piece of advice however... don\u2019t make the logo blue.

Possession of an item alone, such as an empty rucksack or a pair of gloves, may be insufficient to found a charge of going equipped.\"\n \n\n\n\n But while current copyright law in the UK introduced in 2014 [2] allows you to make legal copies of digital content that you own for the purpose of backups or switching to another medium, it is highly ambiguous with respect to media protected by Digital Rights Management (DRM) locks. The law says that if you wish to remove the DRM access control on digital content you may apply to the Secretary of State.\n \n\n\n\n While the 2014 copyright reforms were hailed as a victory by the Open Rights Group (ORG) [3] they also observe that \"The exception is limited to personal use of lawfully obtained originals, and does not allow any sharing of the works, including with close family members. It also does not allow for the removal of any anti-copy technical protection measures, including those found on most DVDs and Blu-Ray discs. Given most media consumption is moving to a pure digital environment constrained by such measures, it remains to be seen how effective the new right will be in practice.\"\n \n\n\n\n In fact, the current law makes it unlawful to circumvent effective technological measures that restrict access to copyrighted material, even if doing so is required for lawful use, without an application to the Secretary of State. That appears to mean that if you want to make a backup of a film that you have bought you have to ask for Government permission!\n \n\n\n\n But worse, it is illegal to produce, distribute, and possess tools to aid in removing DRM locks. If you are carrying such a piece of software you are effectively going equipped in the digital world.\n \n\n\n\n The Pirate Party thinks that these laws are extreme and in its manifesto for the 2017 General Election [4] it states its intention to see them abolished. That doesn't change the laws of copyright theft, but would make it possible for people to make legal copies of things they already own for backup or to access using other applications. It would also make it possible for libraries and archives to make stores of cultural material. And it would make it possible for those with disabilities (for example, the visually impaired) to have electronic access to material such as e-books so that they can convert the content into a form that they can use.\n \n\n\n\n It should not be a crime to possess a tool that would allow you to use on your own property. Just as it should not be a crime to carry a screwdriver, a gemmy, a hammer and chisel from your home to your workshop. And, frankly, if you choose to break down your own back door, that is your own business. It is the crime that we should focus on, not the possession of tools or software. And access to your own possessions should never be a crime.\n \n\n\n\n [1]\n [https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p\\_to\\_r/public\\_disorder\\_-\\_guidance\\_for\\_prose...](https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/public_disorder_-_guidance_for_prosecutors_on_charging_public_order_and_other_offences_) \n (august\\_2011)/\n [#going](https://twitter.com//search?q=%23going) \n  \n\n [2]\n [https://edri.org/uk-format-shifting-and-parody-copyright-laws-come-into-...](https://edri.org/uk-format-shifting-and-parody-copyright-laws-come-into-force/) \n  \n\n [3]\n [https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2014/victory-format-shifting-and-pa...](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2014/victory-format-shifting-and-parody-clear-last-hurdle) \n  \n\n [4]\n [https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/library/OpenManifesto...](/sites/default/files/library/OpenManifesto.pdf) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["DRM", "Digital Rights", "Copyright", "General Election", "GE2017", "Adran Farrel"], "source": [], "url": "https://legacy.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/adrian-farrel/going-equipped", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022200709/https://legacy.pirateparty.org.uk/blogs/adrian-farrel/going-equipped", "date": "2017-05-20T20:47:35+01:00"}, "/press/pirate-party-uk-launched-their-open-manifesto": {"state": "full", "title": "Pirate Party UK Launched their Open Manifesto", "body": "\n\n\n\n Pirate Party UK launched its\n [Open Manifesto for the 2017 General Election](/sites/default/files/library/OpenManifesto.pdf) \n on Wednesday 17th May, with the core policies of free speech, radical reform of copyright, and the end of mass surveillance of innocent people.

It has fielded a few candidates in European and National elections, but like most small parties it is significantly constrained by the UK electoral system. Despite this, the Pirate Party has started to poll alongside major parties and is looking to build support from the grassroots. The party is standing 10 candidates in the June 2017 General Election.\n \n\n\n\n Find out more about the UK Pirate Party at\n <https://pirateparty.org.uk/>\n or contact\n [[email\u00a0protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": [], "source": [], "url": "https://legacy.pirateparty.org.uk/press/pirate-party-uk-launched-their-open-manifesto", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022210314/https://legacy.pirateparty.org.uk/press/pirate-party-uk-launched-their-open-manifesto", "name": "Mark Chapman / David A Elston", "email": "[email\u00a0protected]", "date": "2017-05-19T11:00:00+01:00"}, "/press/pirate-party-uk-hits-new-record-ballot-boxes": {"state": "summery_only", "summery": "", "url": "https://legacy.pirateparty.org.uk/press/pirate-party-uk-hits-new-record-ballot-boxes", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201022203326/https://legacy.pirateparty.org.uk/press/pirate-party-uk-hits-new-record-ballot-boxes", "title": ""}, "/blog/editor/pirate-party-set-success-germany": {"state": "full", "title": "Pirate Party set for success in Germany", "body": "\n\n\n\n There's a general election in\n [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_federal_election,_2009) \n in September, and the German Pirate Party,\n [Piratenpartei](http://www.piratenpartei.de/) \n , looks set for success. According to\n [Spiegel](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,641061,00.html) \n , the conditions are just right for them.\n \n\n\n\n Germany has recently introduced a law against child porn. Fair enough you may say, but Internet experts in Germany think the solution proposed is technically not up to the job, and civil liberty campaigners fear the system will be used to censor other material (they're probably right).\n \n\n\n\n This is part of a wider problem: many Germans today, particularly younger ones, use the Internet as an integral part of their daily life, whereas many other Germans, particularly older ones and politicians, see the net as something alien which needs to be controlled. As Spiegel\n [puts it](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,641061,00.html) \n :\n \n\n\n\n> \n> \n>  It has become clear that the political landscape is split by a digital trench. On one side of the divide are those who see the Internet as the haunt of terrorists and child molesters, and who are calling for more control. And on the other side are those who value the Web as part of their personal freedom. They view it as an environment in which they can feel completely at ease when it comes to organizing their lives, work, friendships and romance online. And for them, the Internet is also a place of protest.\n>  \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\n So who will German digital natives vote for? Not Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU; the minister who came up with the Internet censorship law belongs to her party:\n \n\n\n\n> \n> \n>  Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and Family Minister Ursula von der Leyen -- both CDU members -- are associated within the Internet community with online surveillance of criminals and blocking Web sites. As a result, images of the two politicians have appeared on thousands of Web sites, next to slogans like \"Stasi 2.0\" (a reference to the East German secret police) and \"Zensursula,\" a play on the German word for censorship and von der Leyen's first name.\n>  \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\n They probably won't vote for the SPD either: they support the censorship law, and their chairman Franz M\u00fcntefering still uses a portable typewriter.\n \n\n\n\n What about the Greens? They are conflicted -- some support the censorship law, others oppose it.\n \n\n\n\n The Free Democrats? They are tainted by their past support for government snooping:\n \n\n\n\n> \n> \n>  The hard core of the Internet community resents the FDP because legislation enacted in 1998 that allowed the police to conduct electronic surveillance in private homes was approved when the FDP was part of a coalition government.\n>  \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\n In fact there's only one choice that German digital natives can make, that will send an unambiguous signal to the political establishment: hands off our Internet, hands off our freedom, hands off our rights.\n \n\n\n\n That choice is Piratenpartei.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "", "tags": ["International", "Pirate Party Germany"], "source": [], "url": "https://legacy.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/pirate-party-set-success-germany", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201205950/https://legacy.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/pirate-party-set-success-germany", "date": "2009-08-10T00:00:00+01:00"}, "/blog/editor/membership-update": {"state": "summery_only", "summery": "", "url": "https://legacy.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/membership-update", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201201455/https://legacy.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/editor/membership-update", "title": ""}, "/blogs/danfox-davies/land-ahoy": {"state": "full", "title": "Land Ahoy!", "body": "\n\n\n If ye can't be reading all of the links, just hover your mouse to see where they point to.\n   \n\n  \n\n Long has the good ship United Kingdom been cast adrift in the Sea of\n [Fake News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news) \n and threatened by the harsh maelstroms a-swirling in the Sound of\n [Troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles) \n .

It was quickly tracked, monitored, and identified by many Information Security experts around the world. By 7.30pm (4 hours after detection) the BBC was reporting that the attack had been seen in 74 countries.\n   \n\n  \n\n This particular ransomware targets a known vulnerability in Microsoft operating systems that was patched on 14th March this year (MS17-010) for all supported operating systems.

Since the vulnerabilities were fixed, in MS17-010 you can easily protect yourself against this attack.\n   \n\n  \n\n \"Currently the ransomware is spreading at a rate where shortly before 16:00 today there were over 9,000 infected individual IP addresses.\n   \n\n  \n\n \"This malware works by pivoting from machine to machine using a Server Message Block (SMB) exploit (utilising a mechanism used for connecting to network drives).

It has fielded a few candidates in European and National elections, but like most small parties it is significantly constrained by the UK electoral system. Despite this, the Pirate Party has started to poll alongside major parties and is looking to build support from the grassroots. The party is standing 10 candidates in the June 2017 General Election.\n   \n\n  \n\n Find out more about the UK Pirate Party at\n <https://pirateparty.org.uk/>\n or contact\n [campaigns@pirateparty.org.uk](mailto:campaigns@pirateparty.org.uk) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "\n\n\n Earlier today we saw the WanaCrypt0r 2.0 ransomware (the updated version of the WCry ransomware that first appeared in March) spread across the globe infecting companies and organisations ranging from Telefonica in Spain to the NHS here in the UK.\n \n[@malwrhunterteam](https://web.archive.org/web/20170614125920/https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam) \n starting posting about it on Twitter when it was infecting countries other than the UK, then a few hours later there were reports of the NHS under cyber attack.\n   \n\n  \n\n Whilst early media...\n \n\n\n\n", "tags": [], "source": [], "url": "https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/press/out-date-operating-systems-leave-nhs-open-latest-cyber-attack", "where": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614125920/https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/press/out-date-operating-systems-leave-nhs-open-latest-cyber-attack", "date": "2017-05-12T21:00:00+01:00"}, "/campaigns/national-teams/press": {"state": "full", "title": "Press Team", "body": "\n\n\n## \n What is the Press team?\n\n\n\n The Press team is responsible for promoting the Pirate Party UK in the media and responding to general requests for information about the party.Through the use of the mailing list,\u00a0 and PiratenPad, the Press team writes releases which are sent to the media.\n \n\n\n\n Releases are based on current events that the party should comment on or things that the party has done.\n \n\n\n\n During an election, candidates are recommended to have local press teams specifically for their constituency.

It applies to the Internet and copyright the same \"survival of the richest\" (or those with the best lawyers) mentality that surrounds the UK's libel system.\n \n\n\n\n The programme quickly demonstrated an element of laziness by directly quoting a figure from the BPI as to the losses they claim the industry feels due to online copyright infringement - a figure the presenter failed to challenge. At no time has any evidence been published to support any claims of 'loss'. Such claims are often derived from estimates extrapolated from assumptions made about guesses and are wildly divergent depending on who is making the claim, even if they purportedly represent the same loss.\n \n\n\n\n Similarly the presenter never challenged the often repeated misunderstanding that the record industry - a middleman group that profits from the creative efforts of others - is essential to the greater music industry. Music existed for millennia before the recording industry existed, and will continue to exist long after the current blight business have been reduced to an unpleasant stain on the history of art and music.\n \n\n\n\n Those interviewed seemed only too happy to blame piracy for all their troubles - never questioning whether the closure of small record shops, or the decline in signing of new artists might be at least partly due to other causes, such as the convenience of online shopping (as seen in many other industries) or the unwillingness of the large record companies to invest in anything new or innovative.\n \n\n\n\n The government representative (Stephen Timms, MP) compared Internet use to electricity (noting that one should use both for legal purposes only) but failed to take the comparison further; electricity is not cut off at the mere allegation of unlawful conduct, nor do we expect electricity companies to spy on our usage. Electricity is seen as a vital utility and now most British people think the Internet is as well.\n \n\n\n\n While the programme studied the effect that technical measures targeted at one IP address on a family (noting correctly that the IP address could not even identify an offending subscriber) it failed to consider what effect this might have on other communal Internet services such as those in libraries, universities or even the open wireless projects being run by many businesses and even cities.\n \n\n\n\n Finally, it was suggested that there is an overall decline in music sales, something that even the BPI's own facts\n [disagree with](http://ktetch.wordpress.com/2009/12/04/p2p-hurts-uk-music-sales/ \"P2P Hurts UK Music Sales\") \n and that this was the \"last roll of the dice\" for the music industry when, as it was earlier pointed out, it is the record industry, if anything, that is suffering as more and more musicians and other artists realise the potential of the greatest technological, social and cultural development of the last 50 years.\n \n\n\n\n These are only the greatest of the mistakes Pirate Party representatives noted. Without an appropriate balance, it was impossible for these errors to be exposed, and misstatements were not met by corrections from those of the opposing view or the presenter. Allowing each side to respond to each other is a vital component of true journalism and debate. The lack of opposing views in the Panorama programme meant that it came frighteningly close to becoming a propaganda piece for the content distribution industry.\n \n\n\n\n Pirate Party leader Andrew Robinson said\n \n\n\n\n> \n> *The BBC have let the public down by failing to present both sides of the argument. The Digital Economy Bill threatens many core principles of law; the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, the right not to be subjected to collective punishments, and the right to free speech. I looked to Panorama to warn the public of the dangers of a law quite literally written by the BPI, instead I saw a programme that was more akin to a press release on the behalf of the handful of major record labels that are pushing the bill through parliament.* \n> \n\n\n\n The Pirate Party stands firm, however, in it's defence of freedoms and honesty, and will be happy to provide evidence and factual statistics to the BBC, should it desire to publish corrections, or any other media representative that wishes to report on the facts, rather than half-baked hyperbole and scaremongering.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "\n\n\n The Pirate Party UK has come out as highly critical of the\n [BBC's recent Panorama programme](https://web.archive.org/web/20150413103134/http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00rl4dl/Panorama_Are_the_Net_Police_Coming_for_You/ \" Panorama, Are the Net Police Coming for You\") \n for its disappointing coverage of the Digital Economy Bill.\n \n\n\n\n Although Panorama attempted to give a fair hearing to both sides of the controversy surrounding the bill, it was ultimately considered inadequate.

This was the first opportunity for our current elected officials to have their say and yet took place within hours of the government announcing the general election.The wash-up process, which gives extremely limited time for scrutiny and debate, is supposed to be used solely for non-contentious legislation. The Digital Economy Bill, with over 20,000 letters sent to MPs, over 35,000 signatures to a petition against it, ISP campaigns against it, business coalitions opposing the Bill, and government back-benchers opposing the provisions in the Bill, is not non-contentious. Fiona Mactaggart, Labour MP, describes the parliament as \"utterly feeble in so many ways\", including the assignment of just two hours for committee, report, and third reading and failing to properly scrutinise the Bill. The two hours left for the Commons to consider amendments to the Bill comes at the end of over 50 hours of debating in the House of Lords, after which many Lords were still unhappy with the result. This is an important issue that will shape the entire future of technological and artistic progress, and this bill clearly defines Britain's position as a technological laggard.\n \n\n\n\n Despite all the opposition to this Bill from without and within Parliament, barely a handful of MPs turned up and spoke in the debate (at one point, fewer than 15 members were sitting). At its peak, around 40 members were in the house - just 5% of our so-called representatives. Prior to Second Reading, the Conservative Party confirmed their support for the bill, and debated broadly in favour during the discussion and, despite pledging to oppose the Bill, the Liberal Democrats were only represented by one MP who stated that they would support all but one clause of the Bill, demonstrating that, as predicted by the Pirate Party, none of the front benches has the will to oppose this Bill or the wholly undemocratic process by which it is being forced through.\n \n\n\n![](https://web.archive.org/web/20150317063544im_/http://camp-dev.pirateparty.org.uk/sites/default/files/DEB_election.PNG \"Democracy at work - Parliamentary Copyright 2010\")\n  \n\n\n As expected, the arguments for the Bill consisted of the combination of misleading terminology (such as stating that copyright infringement is theft), dubious statistics that seemed to vary depending on who was speaking, dismissal of the opposition as deluded students and freedom fighters and with one citizen being labelled as \"bonkers\" simply for challenging the misconceptions of the failing branches of the publishing industries. It was even claimed that the new business models that the government should be encouraging (rather than trying to support the old ones) cannot succeed with the current rates of piracy; something clearly contradicted by the many, highly successful, innovative content distribution systems such as iTunes, Hulu (in the United States of America) and Steam/Stardock.\n \n\n\n\n Graeme Lambert, parliamentary candidate for Bury North commented on some of the inaccurate notions held even by the ministers.\n \n\n\n\n> \n>  Under EU legislation, ISPs are not under any obligations to monitor what their customers are doing. As we discovered at the Counter2010 conference, which no other political party attended, Deep Packet Inspection would not allow ISPs to differentiate between purchased content, CC licensed content or pirated content. What the Digital Economy Bill proposes for ISPs to have to do is not practical for the large ISPs, let alone the smaller ISPs with limited funds available.\n>  \n\n\n\n He went on to say:\n \n\n\n\n> \n>  The 3-strikes legislation was introduced in France in late 2009 and since then there has been a rise in the amount of people downloading pirated content. Why does our government insist on using legislation in our country that has failed miserably in others?\n>  \n\n\n\n> \n>  Stephen Timms MP stated that as new technology is invented there will be the need for new legislation to be brought through to continue to combat piracy. That statement right there proves that the government does not want innovation and does not want to encourage advances in technology. The creative industries should adapt their business models to use advances in technology to their financial benefit.\n>  \n\n\n\n> \n>  Economic rights of the publishing industries should not take precedence over human rights of the consumers. Protecting the profits of the monopoly companies over protecting my right to privacy is wrong in every single way and I will fight for my privacy and everybody else's during and after my election campaign.\n>  \n\n\n\n The Pirate Party takes strong concern with Michael Connarty's statement, on the public record, that our Swedish Collegue, Rickard Falkvinge, leader of the Swedish Pirate Party, is incarcerated. \"The rumours of me being in jail and therefore unable to communicate are greatly exaggerated!\" states Mr Falkvinge. With this glaring and obvious error by the Labour Representative for Linlithgow and East Falkirk, it brings to light the obvious lack of knowledge and disregard for facts by current members of the government.\n \n\n\n\n The debate also highlighted the importance of the Internet to the democratic process - which is being treated so trivially by some. During the course of the day nearly 18,000 tweets were made about the Bill (#debill), some from within the chamber. It is impressive to see this level of interaction between the public and their elected representatives, even if some of the more established members seemed more interested in the comments on their clothing rather than the Bill and the wash-up process.\n \n\n\n\n Andrew Robinson, leader of the Pirate Party and parliamentary candidate for Worcester, noted that \"when John Redwood and Austin Mitchell both agree on something, its obviously time for the front benches to take notice.\" He continued:\n \n\n\n\n> \n>  The government are still sticking to the ridiculous idea that writing letters will change attitudes to sharing online. The public will ignore the letters, in exactly the same way MPs have ignored thousands of requests for proper debate.\n>  \n\n\n\n> \n>  It's absolutely scandalous that the massive file sharing communities have not just been ignored, but actively demonised. MPs need to be reminded that file sharers have votes too.\n>  \n\n\n\n The Pirate Party strongly criticises both the content of the Bill and the manner in which it is being rushed through Parliament and encourages all individuals to request that their MP vote against the majority of the Bill during tomorrow's final debates. It is unacceptable that Parliament attempts to push dangerous legislation through in this way, and now on 6th May the public will have the chance to vote for candidates that believe in true debate and democracy, by voting Pirate.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "\n\n\n This afternoon saw the second reading debate of the highly-controversial Digital Economy Bill in the House of Commons.

What's important is that every student with an interest in technology should be encouraged to study the science, the mathematics, the engineering that lies behind it.\n \n\n\n\n But it's not all about maths and science - one of the things that we've seen very clearly in the past 10 years is that what makes new technology (like the iPad) innovative and exciting, isn't just the nuts, bolts and software behind it, but the beautiful design and intuitive user interfaces.\n \n\n\n\n> \n>  Over the past century the UK has stopped nurturing its polymaths.

Last week the Party submitted its response to Ofcom's\n [consultation on the Initial Obligations Code](http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/copyright-infringement/ \"Ofcom | Online Infringement of Copyright and the Digital Economy Act 2010\") \n ; part of the measures on online infringement of copyright included in the Digital Economy Act 2010. This Code lays out a process by which Copyright Owners (or their agents) can target those they feel are repeatedly infringing their copyright with more precision. While the implementation of such a Code (expected in early 2011) could help reduce the number of threatening letters received by innocent citizens, the Party is concerned with an alarming number of elements that appear lacking in the draft Code produced by Ofcom.\n \n\n\n\n The Code lacks purpose and intention. Despite a requirement that the measures in the Code be \"proportionate to what they are intended to achieve\", Ofcom have indicated that they have not been informed as to what the purpose of these measures is. Without clear criteria for success or failure it will be challenging to gauge their effectiveness when considering adapting, renewing or repealing the measures, or implementing further Technical Measures on subscribers. The Party is concerned by the idea that strong copyright protectionism seems to be treated as a goal in itself, without considering what damage this may do to creativity.\n \n\n\n\n The Code lacks balance. Despite the notion that these measures are designed to protect all copyright, the Code is clearly set up to aid only the more powerful businesses, not small, independent companies or individuals who will not have the legal or financial resources to use the measures included in the Code. If the Code is not radically rewritten it is likely to only help those companies with large catalogues of copyrighted works gain more money, while providing no direct protections or benefit for individual creators.\n \n\n\n\n The Code lacks clarity. The current draft struggles when trying to distinguish between those who provide an Internet service (ISPs) and those who use one (subscribers). This vagueness will leave many businesses and individuals, as well as libraries and universities uncertain as to what obligations may be placed on them and what steps they may need to take to protect themselves from heavy fines (up to \u00a3250,000) or legal action.\n \n\n\n\n The Code demonstrates a lack of consideration. The measures in the Code as it stands are likely to have a chilling effect on the use of Wireless networks for connecting people to each other and the Internet. The vague definitions mentioned above will force any business, individual or city thinking to offer a free and open wireless Internet service to carefully consider how many protections and limitations this Code would require them to make. Any dream or hope of large-scale open wireless Internet will be driven far away if this Code comes into effect.\n \n\n\n\n The Code shows a lack of understanding of the technologies involved. Typical of government approaches to the Internet, the draft Code contains some worrying assertions on what evidence is required to prove online copyright infringement. In particular, and despite numerous academics and technical experts stating otherwise, an IP address is considered to be sufficient proof of a subscriber's identity. Little more than a number, it seems this information will be enough to punish an individual and any who share that individual's connection, while making it effectively impossible to defend against false accusations. The Party was also deeply concerned to see that this was deemed sufficient evidence based on the advice of \"agents working on behalf of Copyright Owners\" who have an interest in ensuring the effort and costs required of them are minimised, rather than the advice of technical experts who might be more impartial.\n \n\n\n\n The Code lacks transparency. By deciding not to provide guidelines for evidence gathering, how to protect one's network or even on what information should be included in notifications sent to subscribers, Ofcom seems to have failed its requirement that the Code be transparent. Without much clearer rules both for Copyright Owners and ISPs, consumers and subscribers will be left at their mercy with little or no protection. In particular, the Quality Assurance approach suggested evidence gathering seems woefully inadequate for ensuring that Copyright Owners provide robust evidence and make accurate allegations. Similarly, leaving it up to ISPs to provide information on ways to protect oneself against unauthorised use of a network, where to acquire legal download services and what the purpose of copyright is (not defined in law since 1710) a large range of worrying possibilities for misinformation and abuse is opened up.\n \n\n\n\n The Code lacks proportionality. The time-based threshold suggested for sending further notifications and adding subscribers to a \"Copyright Infringement List\" is wildly disproportionate in that it could treat an individual accused of downloading three short songs (a month apart) more harshly than one accused of downloading an unlimited amount of material over a short period of time. This lack of proportionality (required of the Code by law) highlights how these measures seem to be more about creating a climate of fear rather than recovering financial damages caused by copyright infringement. A system based on the value of the work infringed would, by definition, be proportionate, would be in line with existing civil measures against infringers and would help identify the direct financial effect of online copyright infringement to those businesses using the Code.\n \n\n\n\n The Code lacks justice. The draft Code contains no provisions for a subscriber to defend themself from accusations made in a Court, with the legal protections and defences the system provides. The Code effectively creates a separate legal system where an allegation can lead directly to a punishment with the only appeal possible being through an individual appointed by Ofcom. While alternative dispute systems are increasingly popular across many areas of civil law, access to a Court is vital to ensure that any lack of balance between the involved parties (in terms of financial and legal resources) is minimised. Without these protections it will be even harder for justice to be served in the likely event that false accusations are made.\n \n\n\n\n The Code ignores evidence. The code, and indeed the Digital Economy Act that has prompted the creation of the code, has ignored the vast quantity of evidence that contradicts most of the basic assumptions enshrined in the code. Instead the code appears derived from a series of claims that are only rivalled in their lack of substance, by those that can lead to enforcement under the code.\n \n\n\n\n Finally, the Code lacks democracy. This Code has been drafted by Ofcom based on vague guidelines in an Act forced through Parliament with little or no scrutiny from our elected representatives. It is the job of Parliament to debate and write law, not just rubber stamp what is put before them that they are assured is suitable by lobbyists or ministers.\n \n\n\n\n Andrew Robinson, leader of the Party noted:\n \n\n\n\n> \n>  We believe that Ofcom has been placed in an impossible position by the obligations imposed on it by the Digital Economy Act. There are inevitably many loopholes in the draft code, many terms used that are ill-defined, and many potential issues with human rights, European law, etc. We suggest that Ofcom should force the Government to take responsibility for the problems with the Act by writing a code that fulfils its legal obligations under that act, but is unusable.\n>  \n\n\n  \n\n\n The Pirate Party UK looks forward to the published statement from Ofcom on this consultation (expected in September) and in the meantime will continue to uphold its election promise to fight for copyright reform, personal privacy and freedom of speech. The Party feels that the Digital Economy Act stands against all three of these ideas and while it is not yet in a position to fight against the Act from within Parliament, will represent the wishes of many voters and citizens to the best of its ability by holding the government (and in this case, Ofcom) to account and mitigating the worst of the Act.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "\n\n\n During the gaps between elections the Pirate Party is working hard to protect the rights of citizens and businesses across the country.

These modified images were used promotionally by the parties for the campaign, which flies in the face of the BBC's principles.\n \n\n\n\n Andrew Robinson, party leader and candidate for Worcester said,\n \n\n\n\n> \n>  When the Digital Economy Act rules come into force, members of the public will face disconnection from the 'net for simply looking at infringing content like this. I have had enough of this hypocrisy, it's time for some balance and fairness in copyright law. It's time to vote Pirate.\n>  \n\n\n  \n\n\n In response to the infringement, Jack Nunn, the Pirate Party candidate for Cities of London and Westminster, said,\n \n\n\n\n> \n>  The Digital Economy Act 2010 was widely viewed as a content industry sponsored document, passed before any realistic method of enforcement was ever debated. The fact that both the Labour and Conservative parties have played down their own infringement further reinforces the irrelevance of this Act in the information society.\n>  \n\n\n  \n\n\n Under the \"three strikes\" principle implicit in the Digital Economy Act, Labour could already be 'cut off' from the Internet. Furthermore, their claim that it was an \"innocent mistake\" would not stand up as a defence under the act.\n \n\n\n\n Whilst the Pirate Party UK believes that derivative works like this should not necessarily be unlawful, they currently are. The use of copyrighted imagery in this manner highlights the disconnect between what people commonly think the law should be and what it actually is - even the campaign managers for major political parties seem to agree the law is out of line with common sense.\n \n\n\n\n The Pirate Party UK is fielding nine candidates in the general election, and campaigns to legalise non-commercial file-sharing. It also campaigns to reduce the duration of copyright to a maximum of ten years and have all BBC content released under a Creative Commons license that allows it to be shared and modified for non-commercial use. Besides copyright, the Party has policies regarding patents, privacy and freedom of speech.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n", "summery": "\n\n\n Parliamentary candidates from the Pirate Party UK have accused Labour and the Conservatives of being \"hypocrites\" after both parties repeatedly infringed on the copyright of others during their election campaigns.\n \n\n\n\n Shortly before parliament was dissolved, both parties colluded to force through the Digital Economy Act 2010.
